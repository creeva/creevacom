				<p>Star Wars has been an active part of my life literally as long as I can remember. &nbsp; There hasn&rsquo;t been a time since I&rsquo;ve been able to remember that Star Wars hasn&rsquo;t been a key mythological piece of my life. &nbsp; Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: A New Hope) was the second movie I ever saw in a movie theater. &nbsp; The first movie was Rocky. &nbsp; Depending on when my parents managed to get to the theater I was under a year old or just had my birthday. &nbsp; We will just go with the fact that it was one of the greatest gifts my parents could have given one year old me.</p>
<p>Obviously I don&rsquo;t remember seeing it. &nbsp; However, the fact that I was a part of that mythos in the theater experience is something I hang onto. &nbsp; Because of my parents dragging a baby along into the theater &ndash; I can say something that few people under forty can say &ndash; I saw all the Star Wars movies in the theater. &nbsp; I have even seen them all more than once.</p>
<p>As a child my grandparents bought me Star Wars toys. &nbsp; Around age 4 I got the TIE&nbsp;Fighter that had wings that popped off. &nbsp;Unfortunately the wings eventually separated from the plastic supports that made them pop off. &nbsp;My father spent way too many fixing and gluing the wings, but eventually I just had a TIE&nbsp;Fighter without any wings. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t matter; this was still an important toy of my childhood. &nbsp; From taking the figures into the sandbox or keeping me company on road trips &ndash; Luke, Han, R2-D2, and the rest kept me company. &nbsp;My&nbsp;grandmother was going to get me the complete collection of figures. &nbsp; Unfortunately she passed away when I was six. &nbsp; For some reason the rest of my family was never as invested into satiating my Star Wars desires.</p>

<p>By the time I entered into Open Door for elementary school everyone was obsessed with Star Wars. &nbsp; It was a regular thing to play Star Wars on the playground. &nbsp; There was the four-way jungle gym that was the Millennium Falcon when we played. &nbsp; The monkey bars were normally designated to be an X-wing for whoever was Luke that day. &nbsp; I dressed up in cheap Star Wars Halloween costumes in my younger years, but eventually these became hard to harder to find. &nbsp; I always wanted one of the good Star Wars masks. &nbsp; Spencer&rsquo;s at Midway Mall carried an assortment over the years &ndash; including the helmets for Vader, Stormtroopers, Boba Fett &nbsp;&ndash; and curiously a Tusken Raider. &nbsp; My parents wouldn&rsquo;t buy me the expensive masks. &nbsp;It wouldn&rsquo;t be until the prequels were released that I would get a decent Vader helmet. &nbsp; I also own two high quality Stormtrooper helmets and toy quality helmets for Boba Fett and Clone Troopers. &nbsp;Every time I put them on, I&rsquo;m transported back to that playground in Elyria.</p>
<p>Around my seventh birthday I had money that I was going buy myself a birthday present. &nbsp; I knew what I wanted, it just depended on if the store had it. &nbsp; My parents drove me to Gold Circle and let me loose with my babysitter. &nbsp; Why my babysitter was there, I had no idea. &nbsp;Maybe she wanted to buy a new record. &nbsp; Regardless she went to take me to the toy section to pick out something to buy. &nbsp;I wanted a light saber. &nbsp; This wasn&rsquo;t one of the nifty light sabers that retract like kid&rsquo;s have today. &nbsp;This was a tube on top of handle that stayed open full time. &nbsp; &nbsp;It was the best that it could be at the time.</p>
<p>This light saber was my prize. &nbsp;It made swooshing sounds as you swung it. &nbsp; It would have allowed me to finally be the Jedi I always wanted to be. &nbsp; My babysitter had other thoughts. &nbsp; She told me that it would break in a couple days and I should get something else. &nbsp; Now I was seven, so I was cowed by the authority figure my babysitter represented. &nbsp; I tried to argue and justify, but it all just died down. &nbsp; She talked me out of it and I bought something else. &nbsp; I bought something that would last longer and I would get more playtime with. &nbsp;The thing is, I don&rsquo;t remember what that was. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure I just bought whatever she thought was best for me. &nbsp;I chose it to shut her up and so I wouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about getting lectured. &nbsp; The thing is, whatever it was, it is forgotten. &nbsp;I still remember the pain of not getting that light saber over thirty-two years later. &nbsp;That sucks.</p>
<p>Sometime after this the Star Wars craze ended for most people. &nbsp; The toys dried up at the store. &nbsp; People stopped discussing it. &nbsp; If you were still a fan, it was no longer being a part of a moment in pop culture &ndash; you were a geek. &nbsp;If I was lucky I could catch the movies when they were aired on TV as part of a yearly event in the same way that the Wizard of Oz was shown. &nbsp; The thing is half the time my parents wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to stay up and watch the whole thing. &nbsp; I would get to see the movie just up to the Cantina scene for many years. &nbsp; It is annoying now that I look back that my parents wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to stay up. &nbsp;Anytime the special movie was the Wizard of Oz of The Sound of Music they happily allowed me to stay up to eleven or twelve to watch the whole thing. &nbsp; Their idea of an event is much different than that of an adolescent that rarely got the chance to watch his favorite movie.</p>
<p>Eventually it came out on VHS tape, so occasionally I managed to rent one of the movies. &nbsp; These kept them fresh in my mind. &nbsp; When the Amherst Library carried them I would get them every few months when I stayed over at my grandmother&rsquo;s. &nbsp; One day in the Vermilion Library I saw the strangest thing. &nbsp; It was a Star Wars book. &nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t the Han Solo Adventures that I had read or the novelizations of the movies &ndash; it was something new. &nbsp;It was the Timothy Zahn trilogy. &nbsp;Outside of the Marvel Comics, this was the first step into an extended universe of Star Wars. &nbsp;I devoured them. &nbsp; I think by now I&rsquo;ve read them at least three times. &nbsp;I finally knew what happened after the movies and my strong passion was reunited. &nbsp;Unfortunately we still lived in a world where a Star Wars fan was a geek. &nbsp; I had no one to share it with.</p>
<p>My senior year of high school I took drivers education. &nbsp; In that class was a guy named Muska. &nbsp; One night it felt this weird guy from class was following me home so we started talking. &nbsp; His cousin&rsquo;s house was a couple of houses down from my own. &nbsp; He went there until his parents could pick him up. &nbsp;As we did these regular walks we became best friends. &nbsp; We bonded over Star Wars. &nbsp; He introduced me to the X-Wing video game since my family just got a computer. &nbsp; We worked through the Super Star Wars Trilogy on the SNES. &nbsp; He exposed me to the continuing Star Wars universe in the books that picked up after the Zahn novels. &nbsp; We hunted through Jamie&rsquo;s Flea Market for cheap old figures. &nbsp;It was a match made in geekdom.</p>
<p>The first time I got to see any movies from the original trilogy in the theater was in 1994. &nbsp; There was a theater on the other side of Cleveland that was showing all three movies each night for three nights. &nbsp; Muska, my girlfriend Kim, and I packed into the car and made the hour drive to see the shows. &nbsp;When we got there on Friday night A New Hope was sold out. &nbsp;We opted to watch The Empire Strikes Back instead. &nbsp; It was as fantastic as you can imagine. &nbsp; The next day was my graduation party. &nbsp; I told everyone to arrive early because I was going to be leaving in the evening to go back to the theater a second time. &nbsp; I had a shortened graduation party &ndash; because of Star Wars.</p>
<p>Logically you would think we would have seen Return of the Jedi. &nbsp;Unfortunately Kim stated that she wouldn&rsquo;t comeback a third night. &nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if there was some place we had to be or why Muska and I just didn&rsquo;t plan on coming back by ourselves that night &ndash; but this was are last trip to this theater. &nbsp; Knowing this we opted to watch A New Hope. &nbsp; Seeing it on the screen was everything I could hope for. However, I regretted that I could not see all three.</p>
<p>A few months after that I shipped off to my singular year of college. &nbsp; Over the year I went through four and half roommates. &nbsp;The half room mate was a guy who slept on the couch &ndash; yet didn&rsquo;t attend the school. &nbsp;It was a college clich&eacute; that I lived through. &nbsp; My last two room mates though; they both had a love of Star Wars that was parallel to my own. &nbsp; Late night Star Wars discussions and playing X-Wing on the computer lead to a great bond that I will always remember them by. &nbsp; Towards the end of the school year I bought an iguana. &nbsp; It was already quite large and I named her Mara Jade after a character in the Zahn novels.</p>
<p>After school I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t return. &nbsp; I lived at my mother&rsquo;s house for about a week before I was back together and living with Kim. &nbsp; Unfortunately she didn&rsquo;t want an iguana in the apartment. &nbsp; It was the light saber issue all over again. &nbsp;I loved my iguana, yet wanted the approval of a female. &nbsp; It did have more weight that I was living with this one. &nbsp; Because of that I ended up giving Mara to one of my college roommates who took her back to school. &nbsp; It was sad and she was a good a lizard.</p>
<p>Living with Kim was difficult in many ways. &nbsp; I think the largest is that while she enjoyed geek things &ndash; she didn&rsquo;t want to be seen as a geek. &nbsp;She refused to wallow in the geek mud like I am happy to do. &nbsp; She had an original Empire Strikes Back Millennium Falcon in the box (opened and in played with condition) &ndash; yet it always sat away in the closet. &nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t understand my obsession. &nbsp;They were just movies to her. &nbsp; I would sit and read through Star Wars books and magazines &ndash; she would read trashy romance novels. &nbsp; She went from dead end job to dead end job &ndash; I followed the start of what would become a lifelong career in IT. &nbsp; In theory she was the person I was with that was just like mom &ndash; yet I don&rsquo;t talk to my mother anymore either. &nbsp;It just wasn&rsquo;t going to work for the long haul.</p>
<p>At some point while we were living together, one of her friends just left the military. &nbsp; He had a ton of money to spend since he had been overseas. &nbsp; For some reason, this guy I hardly knew, bought me the 1995 THX edition of the original trilogy. &nbsp; Later I would find out that he had a thing for Kim. &nbsp; Yet, I got a 100.00 collection of the Star Wars movies out of it. &nbsp; Was he trying to get brownie points with Kim by buying me gifts? &nbsp; Was he trying to get brownie points with me so he could go out to the bar with Kim without me saying boo (I wasn&rsquo;t of age yet)? &nbsp; Don&rsquo;t know &ndash; don&rsquo;t care &ndash; I had Star Wars. &nbsp; I watched those videotapes so many times that I don&rsquo;t really care what they ended up doing or not doing. &nbsp; She isn&rsquo;t on my list of highly regarded people anyways.</p>
<p>It was almost three years since I had last seen the movies in the theater. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Special Editions of the original trilogy were being released. &nbsp; I was still dating Kim (unfortunately). &nbsp;I was ecstatic that I would get a chance to see these in the theater again. &nbsp; I was going to go on opening day and have a blast. &nbsp; I was going to take a light saber, make some Jedi robes, and embrace the geekdom that surrounds and binds all the die-hard fans together. &nbsp; But there was Kim&hellip;..</p>
<p>Kim and I had purchased light sabers when they first came out. &nbsp;I hoped it would, but it never filled that void of the lost light saber of my youth. &nbsp;While Kim&nbsp;would take hers up to the haunted schoolhouse, she was embarrassed of it. &nbsp; This was flying a geek flag being a twenty-something with a light saber and she did not let that flag fly. &nbsp;She started making rules about the opening of the movie. &nbsp; There would be no costumes or she wouldn&rsquo;t attend. &nbsp; All light sabers can go, but they had to stay in the car. &nbsp; There would be playing in line. &nbsp; It was like this person didn&rsquo;t know me at all.</p>
<p>The problem lied in the fact that I was about fifteen&nbsp;miles from the theater in Sandusky, OH. &nbsp; I was twenty years old, but I never got around to getting my license. &nbsp; I would sometimes drive her car illegally without a license, but I couldn&rsquo;t take it that day. &nbsp; Muska was busy that day and couldn&rsquo;t go. &nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t find another ride that was available. &nbsp;I had to concede to her rules &ndash; though I did embarrass her by doing Star Wars lines with the crowd while we waited to be let into the theater.</p>
<p>I know I saw them all opening day, but I don&rsquo;t remember if I attended all of them with Kim. &nbsp; I never dressed up. &nbsp; I never took a light saber. &nbsp; I was shamed in the fact that I would participate in the culture, but was still silenced. &nbsp; A few months later I finally got my license and my own car. &nbsp; A few months after that I broke up with Kim, started dating the girl who would become my wife, and never looked back.</p>
<p>The girl who would my future wife was someone who didn&rsquo;t care about what people thought if she was carrying a light saber around. &nbsp;She was someone that wouldn&rsquo;t necessary wallow in the Star Wars geekdom mire &ndash; but would happily watch me do it. &nbsp;I could let the Star Wars flag fully fly. &nbsp;Granted, she is someone who identifies more in the Star Trek universe &ndash; but not everyone can be perfect.</p>

<p>With the Special Edition movies being a success it was announced that a new trilogy was being created. &nbsp;This one was going to be telling the story of Darth Vader. &nbsp; We were all extremely excited. &nbsp; I went down and purchased four tickets for the midnight showing of A Phantom Menace. &nbsp; The movie was being shown at Midway Mall cinemas in Elyria, Ohio. &nbsp;I took my wife Xie, Griffaw, and Josh from work. &nbsp; We waited forever for Josh to show up at the theater as the lines were getting longer and longer. &nbsp; They were showing the movie on three &ndash; four screens. &nbsp;People were in costume. &nbsp; Storm Troopers wandered about. &nbsp;It actually was the crowd I had hoped the Special Edition would have been. &nbsp;Star Wars set it&rsquo;s flag in the sand and out came what will be a series that will never be put down.</p>
<p>Of course there are haters that will state they have always hated the prequels. &nbsp; Did I enjoy episode one as much as the original trilogy &ndash; no. &nbsp; But, Star Wars is Star Wars. &nbsp; We had something new; we had to wrap our heads around Midichlorians. &nbsp; We had to deal with Jar-Jar being added for kids the same way Ewoks were added years before. &nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t matter. &nbsp; Watching Obi-Wan and Qui Gon Jin in the opening of the movie was enough to tell us Star Wars was back.</p>
<p>I got to wander through toy aisles and see Star Wars figures again. &nbsp;Things were great and since that time in 1999 Star Wars hasn&rsquo;t been able to be silenced again. &nbsp;It has been pushed to the side a bit, but it hasn&rsquo;t gone away. &nbsp; That really is the important part of leaving a lasting legacy.</p>

<p>By the time Attack of the Clones was released we had relocated across the country. &nbsp;I had a job at Symantec and the team I was on would go see the big geek movies as a group. &nbsp;We did it with the Lord of the Rings movies; we also did it with Episode II. &nbsp;We purchased tickets to the evening showing as a group and about thirty of us went together. &nbsp;We went to the theater at Springfield Mall in Oregon. &nbsp;This was the first time I saw a Star Wars movies with not just my fandom peers, but a large section of work peers also.</p>
<p>The very next day my Brother-in-Law came down to visit for a few days. &nbsp; What did we do? &nbsp;We went and saw Episode 2 again. &nbsp; I really think the best part of this experience was watching the crowd go wild when Yoda went into battle. &nbsp; No one was expecting it, but at both showings I saw that weekend the crowd cheered. &nbsp;It was a collective emotion gasping for release.</p>
<p>Since the release of A Phantom Menace there was discussions of a MMO coming out to take place in the Star Wars universe. &nbsp; On June 25th, 2003 a co-worker came back from lunch. &nbsp;He had a copy of Star Wars Galaxies. &nbsp; Immediately I told my boss that I was going on lunch break. &nbsp; I went to Springfield Mall in Oregon and purchased two copies of the game. &nbsp;Since this was an MMO we couldn&rsquo;t do the normal buy a single copy and put it on two computers method we did in the past. &nbsp; When I got back to office I immediately called my wife and told her the news. &nbsp; We were both excited and knew what we would be doing that night.</p>
<p>By the end of the weekend we had characters on the Intrepid server. &nbsp; &nbsp;I went by Creeva Murkado and my wife was Xie &lsquo;lanthia. &nbsp;I wrote a few pieces on Star Wars Galaxies over the years. &nbsp;The best article I can refer you to a piece called Intrepid History &ndash; An Entertainer&rsquo;s Farewell (read it here). &nbsp;It was an important part of my life. &nbsp;My wife considers herself Xie and refers to her given name as her slave name. &nbsp; I could rehash and do a few thousand words on it here again, but I&rsquo;ll save that for another time. &nbsp; We lived and breathed in that universe. &nbsp; For the fans it solidified the feelings they always had. &nbsp; On Facebook and other places online I&rsquo;m still friends when many of the people I knew from the game. &nbsp; They are people that will be with me always &ndash; all because of that shared love for Star Wars.</p>

<p>In 2005 Revenge of the Sith was released. &nbsp;This would be the first of the prequels that I wouldn&rsquo;t make it to the midnight showing on. &nbsp; Because of work obligations that kept me up all night we had to go in the morning. &nbsp; At the theater located at Valley River Center in Eugene, we saw the first showing of the movie the next day. &nbsp;This movie was the best of the prequels.</p>
<p>To say I like it would be too shallow of a statement. &nbsp; Of the whole story arc, this is my second favorite (The Empire Strikes Back being the first). &nbsp;This is the movie that the other two built up to. &nbsp; Unfortunately since it was the first showing of the day and not the midnight release, the theater wasn&rsquo;t packed. &nbsp; It lost a bit of being &ldquo;in the experience&rdquo;. &nbsp;It was great being in attendance of the&nbsp;collective enjoyment of that&nbsp;special moment. &nbsp; Because of the harshness and pain as Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader (pre-classic dark outfit) it is the only movie my son hasn&rsquo;t seen yet. &nbsp;We talked to him about it a few weeks ago. &nbsp;We explained our reservations and asked what he thought. &nbsp; He opted to wait a bit longer to watch this one.</p>

<p>There had been discussions of a live action Star Wars TV shows before Revenge of the Sith was released. &nbsp; We are still waiting for that today. &nbsp;In 2008 in preparation for a new animated show Star Wars The Clone Wars was released in theaters. &nbsp; I like to refer to it as the forgotten Star Wars film. &nbsp;It takes place between Episode 2 and Episode 3 and it continued on with a TV Show by the same name. &nbsp;Xie and I saw this on opening day at the theater in Ontario, OH. &nbsp; It had a very light crowd because it wasn&rsquo;t hyped that much. &nbsp;Honestly, until I got there I didn&rsquo;t even know it was animated.</p>
<p>I can say I walked out of the theater saying that it felt right. &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like the sub-story about the baby Hutt &ndash; but I don&rsquo;t have to like every single nuance of the Star Wars universe. &nbsp; This movie showed us that there was hope for more Star Wars movies. &nbsp;Since the prequels turned the first six movies into Anakin&rsquo;s story &ndash; there was a sense of completion to it all. &nbsp; There was talk of future movies taking place after Return of the Jedi &ndash; but that is all it was, talk. &nbsp;A few months after I had the TV show &ndash; I was expecting that is as good as it was going to get.</p>
<p>In 2009 Xie and I had a child. &nbsp; I did get shot down on baby names such as Luke, Han, Anakin &ndash; but this kid was going to grow Star Wars. &nbsp; He did not watch the movies in his first year of life like I did &ndash; but before his second birthday the Star Wars bug bit him. &nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t even my direct fault.</p>
<p>We were feeding him in a high chair and I was playing through the Super Bowl commercials that year. &nbsp;The kid Darth Vader VW commercial came on and he was transfixed. &nbsp;He wanted to watch it over and over again. &nbsp; He had his first experience of Star Wars and wanted into that world.</p>
<p></p><center></center>At ages two, three, and four he wanted to be Darth Vader for Halloween. &nbsp; Xie and I dressed up along with him. &nbsp; The first couple times we were dark Jedi leading on our master. &nbsp;The Imperial marched played from the phone in my pocket and he marched as if he was Lord Vader. &nbsp; He would only break character when no one was around or if he had removed the mask. &nbsp;Later on we bought nice Stormtrooper helmets (I have yet to buy a full outfit) ad escorted him around with the Imperial March still going.
<p>He did take a year off in 2014 to be Iron Patriot since he loves Iron Man. &nbsp;This year however I got to put back on the Stormtrooper helmet and escort Kylo Ren around the neighborhood retrieving candy. &nbsp; The Imperial March was still blaring &ndash; but that&rsquo;s because there hasn&rsquo;t been a theme released for Kylo Ren. &nbsp; It is interesting watching him at this age. &nbsp;Kylo Ren to him is what Darth Vader is to me. &nbsp; Though I identified more with the Rebel Alliance, he identifies more with the Imperial Order. &nbsp; To each their own.</p>
<p>When he was a year old he stayed over at my father&rsquo;s for Halloween. &nbsp;Since he was so young we weren&rsquo;t going to take him around the neighborhood. &nbsp;My father happened to take him out to an event in Reynoldsburg. &nbsp; They stuck him in a chicken costume and I guess he enjoyed the evening. &nbsp; My father did make sure that he sent a picture of my one-year-old son and a Stormtrooper. &nbsp; Maybe he was always destined, regardless of my love for the series.</p>
<p>When my son was&nbsp;almost three he got to see his first Star Wars film in the theater. &nbsp;Well, kind of. &nbsp; It was announced that they were going to re-release all the Star Wars movies in 3-D. &nbsp; The only one they actually got around to releasing was The Phantom Menace. &nbsp; Opening Day we took Lex to the Palace Theater in Lorain to see it. &nbsp; It was a later showing and Lex was three years old. &nbsp; He fell asleep before the Pod Race ever occurred. &nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I fell asleep during Empire Strikes Back &ndash; but hopefully for my parents I did during A New Hope. &nbsp;At least he will be able to say he was there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lex has watched through most of The Clone Wars episodes and some of Star Wars Rebels. &nbsp; He has a menagerie of toys &ndash; and since I found them on clearance a few years ago, a whole army of Stormtroopers. &nbsp; He is a Star Wars addict through and through. &nbsp;During Force Friday we went out early and did the Toys R Us and Target visits. &nbsp; That was when he decided that Kylo Ren was his go to Halloween costume. &nbsp;He is my little Imperial, unfortunately he doesn&rsquo;t get to see The Force Awakens opening day.</p>
<p>Seeing that Revenge of the Sith was a bit rough and he likely wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do a late night, we opted not to take him opening day. &nbsp; Xie and I are going and bearing through the crowds to keep the tradition of seeing it opening day. &nbsp; I know that there are Thursday night showings, but I purposely wanted to see it on opening day &ndash; the 18th. &nbsp; I purchased my tickets the day the pre-release went on sale. &nbsp;We are going to be seeing it in Ontario, OH at 10:20PM.</p>
<p>We are hoping that there is no extreme violence from taking him to see the movie. &nbsp;If that&rsquo;s true we are going to try and take him on Sunday. &nbsp; If not it will be over Christmas break. &nbsp; He&rsquo;s not going to get into the excitement of the crowd yet. &nbsp; I&rsquo;m hoping that maybe the next one he will be seeing on opening day.</p>
<p>When Disney purchased Lucasfilm and Star Wars it was hard. &nbsp; At first was fear &ndash; the fear that they would Disneyfy the universe. &nbsp; Then I looked to the Marvel movies and many of these fears were alleviated. &nbsp;The second was what does this mean? &nbsp; Well in retrospect it will be good &ndash; overmarketed but good. &nbsp; I do have a bit of anger in the fact that they removed the extended universe canon. &nbsp;That was one of the key points of the Star Wars Universe &ndash; everything that was published was canon. &nbsp;Some of it good or bad, but it was all canon. &nbsp;It took me a bit to get over that &ndash; but I&rsquo;ll let it go for now. &nbsp; I just hope I get what I need out of the new movies.</p>
<p>What do I hope out of the movie? &nbsp; I hope I get the same thing I got out of the prequels. &nbsp; No matter what someone feels about the quality of the prequels, they did what they needed to. &nbsp; Every Star Wars movie transported me. &nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t care about Jar Jar or trade negotiations. &nbsp; All those fell to the background. &nbsp; I was a kid playing in a sand box and flying a TIE fighter without wings around the house. &nbsp; I was on the playground jungle gym believing it was the Millennium Falcon. &nbsp;I was yearning for the Gold Circle lightsaber I never got. &nbsp; I was a kid again. &nbsp;As long as it can make me feel that, I don&rsquo;t really care about the overall plot.</p>
<p>May The Force Be With You, Always.</p>
