WordPress crashed, and while I could take time to fix it &#8211; I opted not to. At first, it was &#8220;I&#8217;ll get around to it&#8221;. Then it became &#8220;do I need it&#8221;? For quite a while I wanted to take my site to a static deployment &#8211; removing the backend needs. This really was the opportunity to start on that. The problem was old data. I wanted that back.</p> <p>I previously designed a comprehensive backup strategy. In retrospect, it had some gaping holes in ease of use. Digging through MySQL exports, building new development environments, and tweaking settings because the upload size was too large &#8211; gave me access once again. It was time to tackle another problem &#8211; blog rot. </p> <p>Blog rot is one of those things that just comes over time. Embedded YouTube videos no longer exist. The linked images you used for posts disappeared. Decisions made for optimization cause problems decades later. Blog rot arises from all of these. It was time to do a top-to-bottom clean of the site. </p> <p>This idea isn&#8217;t as pure and simple as it sounds. I started with thousands of posts. The website was a central repository of tweets, image uploads, videos, data from sites that don&#8217;t exist anymore, and general fluff. It was time after two decades to get rid of the litter and noise that I didn&#8217;t need. Unedited backups are safe, but the future site didn&#8217;t need that litter. Posts conceived with original thoughts behind them were the target.</p> <p>With the first cleaning, the site was whittled down to two-thousand posts. The archive still had lots of white noise amongst the soundtrack. Unfortunately, something else turned its ugly eyes upon me. Looking through my posts, there were spelling and grammar issues galore. It wasn&#8217;t unawareness from when I wrote, it just wasn&#8217;t a concern. I wrote a stream of thought. This approach leads to many writing issues for anyone. The downside is that I wanted the writing to pure versus edited. I now have a different view on that approach.</p> <p>I just stared down at the amount of work ahead. The work involved opening each of the two thousand posts and deciding which had a place in the future. The culling survivors would have to make sure they had a working featured image. If an image was missing, stock imagery was used. Each post was scanned by Grammarly. Grammarly highlighted spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues. Those issues were addressed or corrected. Writing this post, Grammarly prompts are almost non-existent compared to the legacy posts in the edit screen. </p> <p>Revisiting writing for the first time in years is an interesting experience. I read a wide variety of topics including family issues, defunct web services, older political views, and general geekery. I remembered each and every post. No matter how random or insignificant, it was remembered. Detachment is beneficial though. Not everything being read was going to survive. Their ghosts haunting the Internet Archive will keep them preserved. </p> <p>Future website development was still going to be done with WordPress. This meant consistency as I was going through. After reviewing, cleaning, grammar, and trimming the blog rot took about a month from beginning to end. From thousands of posts to under five hundred. It was quite the trimming the in the. I left behind a good mix of who I was and what I wrote about over the years. Posts were removed for a multitude of reasons. The largest reason was relevance, specifically relevance to me and not necessarily the site. I will admit that some of the removals were just due to the level of effort to get a post up to snuff. </p> <p>During all of this content work, thoughts and plans started emerging for the backend. I&#8217;ve been trying to get away from my hosting provider for years. I keep it for a site that no one visits. Why should I be paying actual money to keep it going? Time is money &#8211; and that is the larger cost sink though. In the end timing of everything came together. My domain name was coming up for renewal. That caused me to consider now was the right time to start digging into DNS and all that entails. </p> <p>Through all of this, my idea of my hosting needs has changed a bit. Originally I thought about migrating to an AWS hosting solution. My personal journaling script had been running there already. Looking at the numbers though, it was costing me more than my regular host. All I needed was a web directory to host flat files that I could point my DNS to. I ended up testing and migrating to GitHub. Using their page feature was all I needed. It also had the benefit of a free SSL certificate. It does have a downside. Anyone could download the totality of my website easier than just loading a scraper. Thankfully they will only receive the same information a web scraper would provide. </p> <p>The last step of the backend was considering DNS. I ended up using Google and handing more trackable information about myself to the evil overlords. It ended up cutting my domain registration costs in half. Over the next year, I will be migrating my remaining domains over to Google also. For digital items that make no money, but have a cost &#8211; cheaper is better. The .com and .net iterations for my domain were expiring at the same time. Historically, I used the .net as a beta mirror for changes. Since I&#8217;ll be doing changes offline &#8211; that wasn&#8217;t really needed anymore. <a href="https://creeva.net">Creeva.net</a> became a profile linking site that is also hosted on GitHub. </p> <p>The amount of hours is going to save me hundreds of dollars year after year going forward. Everything I&#8217;ve been working on has ended up with tangible and feel-good benefits. In fact, this is going to be my first post going forward. I have to make sure that the RSS flows I have in place continue to function. I&#8217;m also back to if the let&#8217;s write a random post bug hits me, I&#8217;ll be able to actually publish something. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="400" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-07_yahoo_blog-1.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-96125" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-07_yahoo_blog-1.jpeg 600w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-07_yahoo_blog-1-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div> <p>This week it was announced that Yahoo Answers was shutting down. In that fact, I kind of go maybe it&#8217;s time, Reddit has replaced it. The current ownership of Yahoo is not putting in money or updating properties. Likely it&#8217;s time. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/04/yahoo-answers-to-end-as-trump-fans-see-plot-to-silence-conservatives/">Though Ars Technica had an article that the far right is saying this is to silence their speech</a>, this far more falls into a straight business decision to turn off the lights of a very lightly used service than to actually put the thought into what happens if they do. </p> <p>Yahoo was nice enough to provide a method to export your data. Since I&#8217;m a data hoarder of content that I have wittingly or unwittingly generated &#8211; I wanted to get my data before it was gone. It took me four attempts. The first three about an hour after I submitted the request to back up not all my Yahoo data &#8211; but just the section from answers &#8211; I received an email saying that I had canceled my own request. I assure you I did not. I wasn&#8217;t even on the page the second or third time (for fear that a page refresh canceled the request). So that was my first hurdle. But once again, the current owner isn&#8217;t dumping money into the company to fix things &#8211; so you have to expect that some of the rubber bands have snapped and the duct tape is torn by now. </p> <p>The fourth attempt though worked, though not necessarily as advertised. I downloaded a 6.2kb zipped file and was happy that it wasn&#8217;t canceled though it took 18 hours to generate (lack of money means poorly fed hamsters). I thought the file was a bit small &#8211; since I can generate a 3kb text file in my daily journal. But it was compressed, so maybe they spent hours really really compressing it and making it small. They did not. </p> <p>When I opened this file, all that it contains was some .json file (which is fine) and privacy notices. Opening the JSON files, they include solely my basic profile information. It did not include any questions I asked (1) or any I answered (80). You literally are better off and closer to complete to save your Yahoo Answers page to a PDF or an Image. It&#8217;s easier to read and gives you a better look in the long run at what the profile would have looked like. Just all around better. </p> <p>Now I&#8217;m going to go through and manually copy my data out of the service. I have a few weeks and not much data to grab. I just shouldn&#8217;t have to. When I submit a data request that offers to export all of my data out of service &#8211; I expect all of my data. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the data is important or not. Secondary gripe &#8211; everything gives a vague time period (such as over a decade ago) and no real dates. Which for a life logging cataloguer is very very annoying and likely would have been included in a proper data export. </p> <p>While few people reading this will even bother to export their data, just don&#8217;t bother. Look at your profile and manually grab what you need. Between the hoops and problems of the export process, and the lack of information exported, it&#8217;s just going to be easier and more complete to do it yourself instead of trusting the starving hamsters to do an accurate job. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="682" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pexels-photo-801863-1-1024x682.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-96093" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pexels-photo-801863-1-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pexels-photo-801863-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pexels-photo-801863-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pexels-photo-801863-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pexels-photo-801863-1-1070x713.jpeg 1070w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pexels-photo-801863-1.jpeg 1880w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure> <p>As I&#8217;m going through the daily journal generation script I previously mentioned, I made it to the point that I have most of what I can grab on a daily basis. I&#8217;m now working on &#8220;maybe one-day&#8221; items. So this led to Feedburner.com. You see, Feedburner and I go back a long time. Back when APIs were hard to come by and RSS feeds ruled the world &#8211; I routed all my accounts through the Feedburner. It also has the advantage of generating daily emails of RSS items which I still have for historical tracking. I was using it as IFTTT before IFTTT was a thing. It was my central hub which I could manipulate data from. </p> <p>However, let&#8217;s just say it has been a few years since Feedburner and I had any real contact. Saying it has been a decade would likely be about accurate. I showed up sheepishly and looked around, kind of asked how it was going, and just checked in. While on the surface everything seemed to be chugging along as I left it &#8211; underneath the still waters was some anger. You see while 10-15 years ago might have been the height of public profiles and web services &#8211; many of those did not go on. </p> <p>I started by clicking the feed information for the most likely dead and buried web services. Instead of pulling up a page, it showed a 404 error. Then I did the same thing. Feeds that I knew did exist and were good are still working correctly. So while I have the bulk of the work done &#8211; I had to wade through over 100 different feeds. Kind of clicking and saying &#8220;hey I haven&#8217;t been to this domain in a decade what is going on&#8221;. </p> <p>The most amusing to me is the domains that were purchased by other companies. Later they&#8217;ll be going through their referral log and go what is this? I&#8217;ve had to have deleted over 60 defunct and dead feeds. Some of the services it was meh &#8211; I only used them to test the service. Other services gave me a mental tear going down my face &#8211; some good service names or web apps went to dust. </p> <p>We are now in 2021 and instead of RSS feeds being heavily prevalent (and back when I used to do massive cross-posting) &#8211; now it&#8217;s all APIs and cross-posting is almost dead. It was a different time and a different era. In many ways, the internet has gotten smaller &#8211; or maybe just less brave in putting out new ideas. Many things moved to apps and some of those apps don&#8217;t even have standard web page front ends anymore. The idea of the open-sharing web is almost completely dead. </p> <p>Here I am writing on a blog. A personal blog not monetized &#8211; just sharing my thoughts away. This site itself is a dinosaur of another era. Someday all of it gets trapped and vanishes into the tar pits. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Like Legion, this is another one where I just might be late to the party. I don&#8217;t think so though. I think is something that people are not really aware of. The most important thing &#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102932" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/3038597_e5f95e2017.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="386" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/3038597_e5f95e2017.jpg 500w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/3038597_e5f95e2017-300x232.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></em> Like <a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/03/09/want-fantastic-comic-book-tv-watch-legion-fx/">Legion</a>, this is another one where I just might be late to the party. I don&#8217;t think so though. I think is something that people are not really aware of. The most important thing about this feature that you likely aren&#8217;t using is that it is free. Free as in beer and not free as in speech. You do have to own the necessary components, but most people reading this site that are in the Playstation camp likely already have everything they need. So let&#8217;s go over it to catch everyone up with what it is and why it is useful.</p>
<h2>What is Remote Play</h2>
<p>Remote Play allows you to stream games from the PlayStation 4 to a compatible device. Don&#8217;t have a PlayStation 4 to take with you on the road? Well if you have a laptop and a controller, you are good to go. For more advanced geeks, think of it as Remote Desktop or VNC. The difference is that the streaming is good enough to handle videos. The PlayStation Now service currently allows you to stream PS3 games to your PS4 console. This is just a private version of that service. Remote Play works across a local network or across the Internet. The limiting factor is only the bandwidth available. I&#8217;ve had it work in hotels to home Internet &#8211; but your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2>What Supports Remote Play</h2>
<p>Primarily Remote Play supports Windows and macOS. There is also the Sony Experia cell phone, the PlayStation TV, and the Vita that supported this functionality. I have seen a discussion that the Vita and PlayStation TV support is being dropped. This is personally annoying since I am one of the few people who own a Playstation TV device.</p>
<h2>Do I Really Need a Playstation 4 Then?</h2>
<p>Remote Play performs a connection back to your personal Playstation 4. The service will not work in any other way. Simply put, you are required to own a PlayStation 4.</p>
<h2>What Are The Limitations?</h2>
<p>The biggest limitation I have found is this only works in a single-user mode. That means if my wife is watching Netflix on the Playstation 4 in the living room, I can&#8217;t stream a game to my office. Only a single person can access a Playstation 4 (locally or remotely) at a time. If you live in a household like mine where the PlayStation 4 is the main media backend on the TV, you are stuck until it is free. On the plus side, if this is a service you start using all the time, you have an excuse to buy an extra one to stick in a closet or basement attached to your network. If you feel even more at hacking away at new features &#8211; these can also be done with the PlayStation 3. The Playstation 3 supported Remote Play for PSP and Vita devices. By reverse engineering the protocol, some enterprising developers made a version for PS3 to Windows/Mac clients. You can read more about that here. Have any of you ever actually done Remote Play, or am I the only one?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102941" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/39150253_5ded166fe1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /> Two nights ago my wife and were in the hotel sharing a room with my son. The last time this happened my son stayed up most of the night since my wife and I couldn&#8217;t fall asleep early. So this time we both brought bluetooth headphones and were going to watch Netflix. Since my son was on the sofa bed, we could position the laptop to not keep him awake. We thought this was going to be an easy exercise, but it was harder than we thought. After 30-40 minutes we had the whole thing working. I thought I would write it up so no one else had to go through this. Most the discussions when you search for this in Google are on message boards with multiple links sending you somewhere else. Here are the steps that are required.</p>
<ol>
<li> Connect all your Bluetooth headphones to your Mac</li>
<li>Go to Applications &gt; Utilities</li>
<li>Open &#8220;Audio Midi Setup&#8221;</li>
<li>In the plus sign at the bottom left, click and select Multi-Output Device</li>
<li>Rename your Multi-Output Device to something memorable</li>
<li>In the window select both sets of your Bluetooth headphones (if they have microphones they will show up twice, Microphones have 1 channel, and Headphones/Speakers have 2).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you have everything configured you can right-click your new multi-output device and select &#8220;use this device for sound output&#8221;. For immediate concern, you should be all set. If this is something that is going to be in regular use, I recommend a couple of other things. The first is to have your volume control show up on the menu bar. To do this</p>
<ol>
<li>Open System Preferences</li>
<li>Click on Sound</li>
<li>Under Output Devices you can see &#8220;Show Volume on the Menu Bar&#8221; at the bottom &#8211; enable this.</li>
</ol>
<p>On this screen, you can also control different outputs switching between internal speakers and your new multi-output device. However, once you have the volume control in the Menu Bar &#8211; you can switch between different outputs quickly. They will show up underneath the volume control when you click the speaker. Airplay and other output devices will show up as selections. I&#8217;m just hoping for someone else this becomes a 5-minute fix instead of spending an hour clicking different links.</p>

The PS4 stopped loading Netflix and I heard that a web page failed to load from the other room. I took the obvious first course of action and rebooted the router and the modem. To my annoyance, this didn&#8217;t correct the issue. So the remainder of the night we took to watch movies off of Plex. This morning the Internet still wasn&#8217;t working, so I had to announce on my weekly conference call that I couldn&#8217;t do much until things were corrected. However, without anything better to do I went through and troubleshot the issue a bit further. Since I couldn&#8217;t correct it, I should definitely make sure the issue wasn&#8217;t on my end of the connection. I checked DNS, and I was getting DNS resolution. Most of my machines were using Google for DNS, but some use the router. So I checked both methods and DNS seemed to be found. I then moved on to ping testing. I could ping different sites out there in the world, but some of the responses came back very slowly. There could be a delay just slowing things down. I started accessing different sites. Almost all of them would time out, but Facebook and Gmail would load slowly. My ISP&#8217;s own site wouldn&#8217;t load at all beyond the first header, but that could have been pulled from the cache. I thought maybe something was blocking HTTP, but not HTTPS. So I tried other HTTPS sites, and I couldn&#8217;t find any more that would load. The likely reason is Facebook and Gmail have proxy servers directly located on my ISP&#8217;s network and that is why they would work fine. Email was slow but working. FTP would connect and then timeout. So we have two major issues going on. The first is slowness. This was likely increased by constant testing by everyone to see if things came back yet. This would lead to a pseudo-DDoS attack on the systems. The second was why no other web pages were loading. I came to the conclusion that an upstream transparent proxy (or group) had stopped HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Since other protocols were working that means they likely were not routed through this proxy. It could also be that a firewall rule was in place blocking the traffic, but since the outage was about 19 hours &#8211; that should have been found quickly. Rebuilding or rerouting around a proxy server might take tons of reconfigurations of routers and other servers along the way, so it may have all hinged on that server. Being a nice guy who had done all the research and troubleshooting &#8211; and seeing I could access Facebook, I sent a message to the ISP of the issue and the symptoms. Of course, it was a Facebook moderator who knows nothing about any of what you just read, they gave me the standard &#8220;thank you, we are aware there are outages in your area and we don&#8217;t have an ETA for service to resume&#8221;. That person calls it an outage when his page doesn&#8217;t load and doesn&#8217;t look any further than rebooting the modem. Nothing I found out helped me get connected to the wider world any sooner. But I understood the problem even though if I called tech support, they would have had no clue what I was talking about. That&#8217;s fine, it&#8217;s not my monkey and not my circus. Granted I may throw peanuts at the monkey to amuse me and help me get things done, but I&#8217;m still at the mercy of the organ grinder to turn the crank. At least it is all working now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102945" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/39150253_5ded166fe1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/39150253_5ded166fe1.jpg 500w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/39150253_5ded166fe1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /> Now that I have the lights voice-activated, the next thing I go back to is whole house audio. Currently, I have 5 zones to that I can send audio. I have at least 3 and up to 5 more zones I want to put into the house for music. From a computer I can use iTunes and Airplay music out to all zones at once. I also can use the Remote App on the iPhone to control the remote iTunes instance. So in this scenario, I have some control over the whole house audio. While I do have a massive iTunes library, what if I wanted to use something else? What if I wanted to play the music that was directly on my phone? That&#8217;s the complication. IOS devices can Airplay out, but only to one remote zone at a time. So if you wanted to use whole-house audio at my location, you are stuck with using iTunes. It can be a bit limiting sometimes. What I want is something I will refer to as an amplification proxy. The iPhone (or iTunes) could connect to this single zone. Once it was connected to this single receiver &#8211; it could then take the single stream and turn it into three, four, or ten streams (depending on how many zones you have). However, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a product out there. There are ways to trick Airplay to work across subnets since it was originally designed to be local subnets only. I thought this would be my ticket to getting this done, but this software doesn&#8217;t seem to have any method to turn a single stream into multiple. There is another piece of software called Airfoil that is paid software. It allows you to take the audio output of any Mac or Windows program and send it to Airplay speakers. Then they have a separate piece of software that turns the system into a receiver and then pumps it out to the main software all over again. I may actually turn to this, but my problem is that I have to get two pieces of software to work in a wonky scenario. Ultimately I would love a solution that I could run on a Raspberry Pi. It would give me an excuse to buy a new one. I would rather use a homebrew solution and spend the money on hardware than buy a piece of software. Everything I have heard about Airfoil sounds great, but it would be better if a single software package could handle both sides of the equation. So my question to you Internet community &#8211; do you know of a write-up that covers how to do this easily? I know someone else will find this post through Google and see that I also don&#8217;t have an answer, but maybe they will be closer than I am. I&#8217;m also hoping my fellow geeks on Twitter or Facebook will see this and it will remind them of something and they can point me in the right direction. Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95081" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-07-19.43.34-1.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1280" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-07-19.43.34-1.jpg 720w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-07-19.43.34-1-169x300.jpg 169w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-07-19.43.34-1-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /> What does a boy do when he has an extra Raspberry Pi computer sitting around that hasn&#8217;t been taken out of the box in two years? He finds something to use it for. I had another Raspberry Pi that was being used as a media player, but Kodi was slow and didn&#8217;t work that great. I had attempted to use it as an airplay device via Plex &#8211; but that was a stuttering mess. On Reddit though, I found a post that allowed the Wink to be controlled via Siri. This was interesting enough to actually get something working. This started because we were interested in the Amazon Echo. While it can do all sorts of neat things, my focus is really making my life easier. It could control my lights via voice, but since we have a multilevel house, I would multiple devices to be able to contact Alexa. However, my phone is on me most of the time so Siri really is a better option. Time to get things moving. I flashed my old Plex image with a new copy of Rasbpian and proceeded to follow the instructions to install Homebridge (<a href="https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki/Running-HomeBridge-on-a-Raspberry-Pi">instructions are here</a>). Then I followed the remainder of the instructions to get the home kit integration working with Siri which includes installing the Insteon+ app from the App store. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/winkhub/comments/3az1w7/so_i_got_wink_working_with_homekitsiri/">original Reddit post</a> lays it out nicely what you need. I got it up and working and I was quite pleased with myself. However, one issue I came across is that I could not get homebridge to come up at boot time. I have to manually log in via SSH and start it. When I disconnected from the SSH session, the program would stop working. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve regularly used Linux so I had to look up how to start the program in the background and leave it running. Running it as a background process didn&#8217;t work. So next I had to install screens, this corrected the problem since I could disconnect from that session and leave it running. If the Pi reboots, I will have to log in again and restart it &#8211; so let&#8217;s hope that doesn&#8217;t happen too often. I checked the system to see how many resources homebridge was consuming. It was around 15% which is great since I have an original Raspberry Pi B. I have it running on my desk in the attic and I wondered if I wasn&#8217;t using a full Plex installation, could I get better resources and playback from Airplay? I hunted around and found <a href="https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync">Shairport-Sync</a>. I got it up and going and plugged some desktop speakers into it. Originally it stuttered a bit, but it eventually settled into the groove and had no more issues. This adds another room to the whole house audio when I play something. Giving me a grand total of 5 rooms I could sync up and play music too. I still have about 5 more to go. The quality of the pi is considered inferior unless you have a USB sound card, but it&#8217;s passable for the room and uses case. I wouldn&#8217;t go out of my way to use Pi&#8217;s for this purchase &#8211; I can get old Airport Express units that do the job better and cheaper on E-bay. Since this is mainly for homebridge, it&#8217;s a nice little bonus feature I can have to do while it is sitting on my desk.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We have reached that dreaded age that every parent must face. The one where your child wants to be able to make their own phone calls and receive calls from friends. My child is young &#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102939" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/108805307_c43af20f59.jpg" alt="" width="454" height="323" /> We have reached that dreaded age that every parent must face. The one where your child wants to be able to make their own phone calls and receive calls from friends. My child is young enough that we thought we had at least a couple more years before this became a thing. We were wrong though. This started last year and I got a half-baked solution working. It was a bit too complex for him (my wife would say the most things I architect are a bit too complex). In fairness, it wasn&#8217;t dumb easy, but he had it. The problem was it didn&#8217;t work reliably. It used third-party solutions and was ugly. However, it did route through a google voice number tied to my son&#8217;s email account. As an aside, my son doesn&#8217;t have an email account exactly. It&#8217;s an email address we registered when he was born. It was configured as a catch-all address for him to use as an identity. It is controlled by my wife and myself, my son has never logged into it. Any web services that could be tied to him we use as his proxy. All email is forwarded to both my wife and me in our personal email addresses. This is to make sure there is never anything inappropriate sent to that account. One day we will turn it over to him, but not anytime soon. Having a Google Voice just for him tied to this account was something that just made sense. Since my original solution did not work, over time the Google Voice number was surrendered due to inactivity. This was fine since he did not have it memorized and in theory, we could get him a new one at a later date. However, this wasn&#8217;t as easy as it would seem &#8211; but more on that later. Over the last few months, my son was more adamant about people being able to call. I use my phone for personal and business use at all hours of the day. My wife uses hers for various reasons. We did not want to hand out our numbers to everyone to get calls from other kids at any given time. This left my son without an option. We did have a landline, but we don&#8217;t have a phone plugged into it. We have it down to the bare minimum of services so it costs per minute for any call. The only reason we still have it is that it saves us a couple of dollars a month on our total DSL bill. I had nightmares of my son starting to use the phone and running up large bills just talking to grandma. To elevate the service to not be per minute would cost me about $20.00 a month or $240.00 a year. That did not quite make me happy either. It would get worse also. If he called family, all of them are long-distance. So I would have to pay long-distance fees on top of the other costs. I haven&#8217;t paid long-distance fees in years thanks to the cell phone. We had to look for other solutions. Of course, the discussion of &#8220;maybe he should get a cell phone&#8221; came up. I couldn&#8217;t justify that cost either. Especially since my wife and I are grandfathered into unlimited data plans and there would no way to get him on one. With his current iPad usage, I can only imagine the eventual data overages because he was streaming video from the Reading Rainbow app. This was a no go either just for cost and logistical training I would have to try to teach a boy who thinks things just work and has no concept of data. Back to the Google Voice solution. A month ago a friend talked to me about this problem. He used an Obi202 which was routed through Google Voice. This meant unless he was making international calls that all calls were free. All he had to do was purchase the unit itself. It used a wired ethernet connection, but for $20.00 more he got a wifi adapter that worked with it. This was going to be something to look into. I put this in the back of my mind and eventually after again hearing that my son wanted to make his own calls, I ordered it last week. It was 49.99 with free shipping so it would pay for itself in 3 months over changing the phone service. The device came and I let it sit for a few days. I eventually got around to trying and it work on Friday night. The first thing was getting my son a Google Voice number again. You would think would be a straightforward proposition, but it was not. I hooked up a phone to my home phone line and verified it with Google Voice. I then browsed the phone numbers. I found one I thought looked good and selected it. Once I clicked the button, I received the message that would be the bane of my evening &#8220;There was an error with your request. Please try again.&#8221; I tried again. It was the same result. The service might be busy so I waited awhile and tried again. I still wasn&#8217;t having any luck. Then I started searching online. One of the things that came up was the fact if a phone had been used by Google Voice before it couldn&#8217;t be activated in a different account. I have two google voice accounts and this number wasn&#8217;t bound to anything. Just in case though, I would need a new number. Since our cell phones were already activated to our respective accounts I could not use that. I downloaded an app for my phone that allowed you to generate burner numbers. These temporary numbers would work for a set amount of time and then disappear. I paid $1.99 to get a number that would work for 14 days. I received the number and verified Google Voice, then chose a new number to add. The problem was I received the same error message. It seems that something can trigger on Google&#8217;s backend that can block the addition or reactivation of a Google Voice account. There was a thread where they could reset an account, but they put a notice that they no longer did that. Even if I could move forward on that, it would take days to resolve. I was impatient and there has never been a thing like a Google customer support line. I was on my own and I was going to brute force this scenario. I removed all phones from my son&#8217;s Google Voice account. I then opened a new Gmail account. Using this account I forwarded all email messages to my son&#8217;s account &#8211; which in theory should have forwarded it to myself and my wife. Then I went to Google Voice and prepared for the worst. I signed up for the account and verified the number to the burner number I got. Then I went to choose a new number &#8211; and this time it worked. I then went and configured the Obi device. I called the number from my cell phone and everything worked. I then set the burner phone number to never ring and tested it again. Everything was still working as expected. All text messages, voicemails, and missed call notifications would be forwarded to this email address. Everything should be right. Now it was time to test. I sent a text message to the new number. It came through to the new email address, but not his existing one. A Gmail filter later and another test it was getting to his real email address. It seems Gmail doesn&#8217;t like forwarding messages it already forwarded on another account. This is likely to prevent an accidental loop where email just keeps flowing constantly until an email box is full. Since there are different alerts depending on missed calls, text messages, and voicemails &#8211; I had to configure a few filters that forwarded these messages to my son&#8217;s account, my wife&#8217;s account, and my own. This keeps the whole vigilant on what is going on in your child&#8217;s life. The phone he is using is a standard home cordless phone. So he won&#8217;t be doing text messaging anytime soon. However, he loves it as is. His nickname is even part of the phone number (yes I&#8217;m that much of a geek). The last few days as I have been on the road we have been talking on his phone. This gives him just a bit more freedom than he has had &#8211; since in theory, he can have people call him. Whenever he does get a cell phone, he can configure the service for that and keep the same number through however many iterations of phones he goes through in his life. My wife and I will answer the phone first until he learns about wrong numbers and such. Still, it is something more in this world he has for himself. As for the Obi box. If there are no issues in the next few months I plan on purchasing 1-2 more of them. Then my wife will be able to use her old rotary phone to receive calls. I doubt Google Voice supports pulse dialing, so likely it won&#8217;t work for outbound. Just the nostalgia though of having the ability to answer a rotary phone again would be neat. I plan on getting something more comfortable than an iPhone when I have long conference calls. So this would be the reason I would get one for myself. Everything old is new again. Everything is working. It was a frustrating adventure. All my son wanted was to receive calls and make them &#8211; and it turned into this.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The most important thing for anyone in IT is control over your assets and investments. The loss of control can cause you to be vulnerable and helpless even if what you have lost is menial. &#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102934" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/346519139_4af4e316de.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/346519139_4af4e316de.jpg 500w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/346519139_4af4e316de-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /> The most important thing for anyone in IT is control over your assets and investments. The loss of control can cause you to be vulnerable and helpless even if what you have lost is menial. In the modern corporate world businesses are outsourcing projects and infrastructure at an accelerated rate. This means you have to rely on the companies in which you have invested time and effort. If these companies suddenly disappear large investments might be needed to re-architect a solution. I&#8217;m sure some of you reading this have had to deal with that exact situation. While you have corporate disaster recovery or contingency plans to deal with this at work, what do you do when it happens at home? Over the last decade as we have become accustomed to the internet age, we are familiar with web apps or social networks that are hot one day, yet disappear the next. This is the nature of business. We then move on to the next site, re-upload our images, and reconnect with our contacts. It&#8217;s annoying, yet a fact that we deal with. What we have lost is time and possibly some connections. In the age of cloud-connected Internet of Things devices (IoT), this access changes dramatically in the inconvenience. At home, we are investing in smart devices at an increasing rate. If we take out devices we take for granted such as phones, computers, and tablets the items around my house that have an investment in intelligence is quite large. Just off the top of my head, I use a Wink hub to control lighting for almost all the bulbs inside and outside of my house, a Nest thermostat, a generic Z-Wave thermostat, multi-room audio, many game consoles, and streaming devices. My house even has smoke detectors on every floor that alerts me if there is an issue. This has actually worked by sending me a phone alert when my dehumidifier bit the dust in a puff of smoke in the basement. I have heavily invested in different IoT devices that have made my life easier by giving me functionality and scheduling to live without thinking about turning on the outside lights at night. Being a geek I also enjoy the sheer communication and possibilities that these devices give me. Last year however Wink sent out a bad update for their hub. You could send in your device for replacement &#8211; or eventually, if you were tech inclined enough to make a DNS record on your LAN &#8211; a way to reflash the firmware. This wasn&#8217;t really to much of an inconvenience since it was corrected. I had to use the light switch instead of controlling the bulbs from my phone. Life went on and everything was corrected. What if it hadn&#8217;t though? Revolv is an IoT company that makes a competing device for the Wink hub. It was recently announced that they were ending service on May 15th. Revolv has a similar issue to Wink &#8211; it relies on cloud components to allow it to work. This is my largest complaint about Wink overall. If the web service goes down, the devices that you have invested in have stopped working. This means that any lights that were controlled by your Revolv hub will stop functioning as smart devices. Any home automation such as blinds or controlling power to shut off at night for the coffee maker that you route through the hub will also cease. If you are used to your lights coming on and your door automatically unlocking when you are on the porch, wouldn&#8217;t you feel at least a tinge of helplessness? This is sure to happen to some people that have invested in Revolv as their home infrastructure. Not everyone reads alerts and messages from companies &#8211; so a percentage won&#8217;t know about this until it breaks. The end-users don&#8217;t really have recourse either. In the corporate environment, you have contracts that protect you from this process for your corporate data. However, for consumer devices most of these services are free and there is no contract between the end-user and the corporation that allows them any insurance or compensation. Depending on the infrastructure they purchased into &#8211; they might be out hundreds if not thousands of dollars. The devices might become dumb or stop working altogether if the technology is proprietary. Of course, your first claim on purchasing technology such as this is buyer beware. Trust in the company you are investing your devices with. You might pay more to be with a company that has a brand you trust &#8211; but you expect them to be around longer. Personally, I had not heard of Revolv until this story started passing around. However, even if you haven&#8217;t heard of them doesn&#8217;t mean they are not owned by a company you trust. Two years ago Revolv was purchased by Nest. This was after Nest was already owned by Google. Currently, Revolv, Nest, and Google are subsidiaries of Alphabet &#8211; one of the most valuable companies in the world. As companies are expanding the use of consumer devices in a corporate setting they need to take into account scenarios like this. If Revolv uses open technologies, most users and companies that were relying on the service should be able to recover. It will take time to reconfigure everything, personally if this Wink that discontinues service it would likely take me a few hours just to re-sync my light bulbs to a new device or service. It also likely won&#8217;t be a company with the financial backing that Revolv had behind it.</p>
