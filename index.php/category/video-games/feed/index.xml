<p><a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/03/22/retrometrics-double-dribbling-nes/"><em>I originally wrote this post for Duesr.com</em></a></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like <em><a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/02/28/retrometrics-magical-copy-baseball-stars-nes/">Baseball Stars</a></em>, <em>Double Dribble</em> is another game that started out as a cabinet based on the NES Play Choice 10. I was never able to find a dedicated <em>Baseball Stars</em> cabinet, but it seems there was at least one (or a conversion kit) made for <em>Double Dribble</em>. I believe I have seen one for locally once upon a time, but it isn&#8217;t an arcade cabinet I would jump on if available.</p>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100_6482-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-95405" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100_6482-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100_6482-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/100_6482-1.jpg 601w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I found the <a href="http://www.502streetscene.net/forum/showthread.php?t=169485">image for the cabinet on this thread</a></em></p>
<p>You can see in the video below that the <em>Double Dribble</em> arcade cabinet had much sharper graphics and better sound clips. It almost looks so much better than the other Play Choice 10 games, that the home version used significantly less memory.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKgSZmtALEs" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>There is one oddity to the <em>Double Dribble</em> tale. Normally at the time this game was released, most games were released in Japan first and then shipped over to the United States. Konami reversed this for <em>Double Dribble</em>. The North American version was the first to be released. Later in Japan the game was released as <em>Exciting Basketball</em>. The NES version is still the most successful version of the game overall.<br />
Finally, what comes as a bit of a heartbreak to me, there was a sequel for <em>Double Dribble</em> that was created for the Sega Genesis. It was called <em>Double Dribble; The Playoff Edition</em>. With all the time I spent growing up playing <em>Double Dribble</em>, playing it on a non-Nintendo system would feel wrong. It&#8217;s like playing Sonic on a Nintendo system. It could be fun, but the objects would still be aligned wrong in the universe.</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yJwyVxq92G0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><br />
<em>Double Dribble</em> has some quirky gameplay that I found out you can be monumentally out of practice from. I filmed the above video of myself playing the game. This is after at least twenty playthroughs of the game. While I won&#8217;t say I was a <em>Double Dribble</em> all-star, I at least didn&#8217;t want to come off as a monkey randomly hitting buttons.</p>
<p>There are some glitches in the game. The first is whoever jumps last wins the tip-off. The second is certain zones on the court lead to a high percentage of successful shots. I&#8217;m also a firm believer after playing this so much recently that there are certain spots on the court that it is impossible to make a shot from.</p>
<p>You use B to shoot and A to pass. The A button also works as you try to steal the ball from your opponent when you are on defense. Getting back into the groove was an odd experience. However, once you get used to it, it seems quite fluid. It&#8217;s the let&#8217;s do something awkward until it feels right method of learning.</p>
<h2>Family Guy Controversy</h2>
<p>Though I didn&#8217;t think about it when I had the idea to write this piece, it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to talk about<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/fox-stole-a-game-clip-used-it-in-family-guy-dmcad-the-original-160520/"><em> Double Dribble</em> and DMCA controversy last year</a>. In May of last year, <em>Family Guy</em> aired a segment where Peter and Cleveland played Double Dribble. In this clip Peter abuses a glitch in the game where it allows him to make a 3-point shot 90% of the time. Cleveland gets angry at the use of the glitch while Peter keeps going &#8220;Corner Three&#8221;</p>
<p>You would think that the team that works on Family Guy would have just tracked down the game and used their own footage. Unfortunately they took a YouTube clip uploaded in 2009 showing the automatic shot working. They then took this footage and interspersed it with Family Guy dialog and animations.</p>
<p>So the creative team borrowed the clip without permission. Since their whole show is based on satire, I&#8217;m not sure if this would fall under fair use or not. They really didn&#8217;t add commentary, just used it as is. Fox&#8217;s handling of this managed to get worse than stealing someone else&#8217;s work and taking credit for it.</p>
<p>The original uploader of the video received a DMCA takedown request through YouTube stating that Fox owned the footage. So footage that was uploaded years before the script was even written for the episode was now being matched by YouTube&#8217;s content ID system.</p>
<p>It seems since this time, the original footage has been restored. Hopefully they came up with some behind the scenes compensation for the original uploader. It&#8217;s not often you see a retro game make the news, so I thought it had to mentioned. Below are the original and <em>Family Guy</em> versions of the clip in question.</p>
<h3>Original Version:</h3>

<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8Zezfch0es" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center></p>
<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p>I didn&#8217;t own <em>Double Dribble</em>, but through out my seventh grade year I borrowed it quite often from a kid on the next street. For some reason it was one of the two basketball games I played many hours with. The other was <em>NBA JAM</em>. I mention <em>NBA Jam</em> because I think it appealed to me in the same way.</p>
<p>While <em>NBA JAM</em> had fancy animations and the &#8220;<em>he&#8217;s on fire</em>&#8221; hot streak, <em>Double Dribble</em> had those awesome dunk animations. I thought those graphics were amazing and that this was as photo realistic as games were going to get (mind you this was decades ago). It was something that captured my imagination. It was even part of the inspiration (<em>the rest was my father</em>) I tried out for the seventh grade basketball team. The idea that one day I could pull off moves like that in real life gave me hope.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t make the cut of the team. I still had <em>Double Dribble</em> though. I borrowed that game constantly. Unfortunately by the end of the summer that kid and I had a falling out. Our friendship didn&#8217;t recover and I didn&#8217;t have access to tradable games one street away. It&#8217;s sad things turned out the way they did, but it was the start of the lessons of life.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, until I played <em>Double Dribble</em> to practice and shoot the video, I haven&#8217;t touched the game in 27 years. If I was going to get an NES rental, more often than not it was a platformer. <a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/02/28/retrometrics-magical-copy-baseball-stars-nes/">I enjoyed the occasional baseball game</a>, but I had mastered <em>Double Dribble</em>. There would have been no reason to waste rental time on something I was good at.</p>
<p>Playing it was like revisiting an old friend. If this game is something you grew up with, I would highly recommend revisiting it. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have it in more of a rotation now that I&#8217;ve played it again. However, if you didn&#8217;t grow up with it, it will seem too simplistic. For millenials I&#8217;m sure it will seem just a step above a Tiger handheld. While we&#8217;re at it &#8211; I should mention there was a port of Double Dribble to the Tiger handheld. It all comes around&#8230;..</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ranHYz2mp3c" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><em><a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/03/13/retrometrics-first-play-mtv-remote-control-nes/">I originally wrote this for Duesr.com</a></em></p>
<p>This week I thought I would do something different. I would take a game I&#8217;ve never played before and do a first play through. This is going to be an ongoing series going forward. Rules are that I can&#8217;t remember ever playing the game before. The videos will end when a few different things occur, 30 minutes have passed while playing, I have hit a Game Over Screen, or I beat the game (which will likely be very few). With a few of the games I&#8217;ve played in the past &#8211; expect some very short videos. I&#8217;ll be doing some mainstream games, and like this weeks, some esoteric ones.</p>
<p>This week I did <em>MTV Remote Control</em> on the NES. If I have played through this game before, I have no memory of it. It isn&#8217;t something I would have picked up as a rental back when that was a thing. This video doesn&#8217;t include commentary, but that will likely change in future videos.</p>
<p>MTV had a trivia show unapologetically catering to the couch potato generation called <em>Remote Control</em>. The trivia was almost always about TV, and it was hosted by Colin Quinn and Adam Sandler. Funny enough I didn&#8217;t watch this show when it actually was on the air. I was pretty big in <em>Jeopardy</em>, but this was just lighter content that didn&#8217;t grab me.</p>
<p>This game was programmed by Hi-Tek who also did the <em>Jeopardy</em> games for the NES if I remember correctly. Since you have the same three person head to head structure, I&#8217;m sure it used quite a bit of the same backend between the two games. It was likely very trivial to make the questions relevant and change the backgrounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Retrometrics_First_Play_01_-_MTV_Remote_Control_For_The_NES_-_YouTube-1-1.png" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95396" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Retrometrics_First_Play_01_-_MTV_Remote_Control_For_The_NES_-_YouTube-1-1.png" alt="" width="810" height="624" /></a></p>
<p>There are a few things that annoyed me about the game. The first is that you can&#8217;t change your name. Personally I was annoyed that I was called Freddy during the whole game. Since there isn&#8217;t a choice, what can you do? I seem to remember in Jeopardy being able to change your name and choose different avatars. So at the very least this is a step backwards from that. Maybe they though thought the slackers weren&#8217;t going to bother to change it anyways.</p>
<p>The next thing that annoyed me was the second player. He just reminded me of a mashup of George Takei and Archie Andrews. With the few questions he answered, ,I kept expecting him to go &#8220;Oh My&#8221; in a NES digitized speech kind of way. He never did.</p>
<p>Finally the game is too easy. I say that because I&#8217;m from the generation these questions were meant to target. I will bet millennials would struggle since most the shows referenced in the question aren&#8217;t in their syndication or binge watching queue. For someone who grew up back then though &#8211; almost all would have been simplistic. I did do horrible at the MASH category, but then again I wasn&#8217;t big into that show. I have a little brother (who is a millennial) that would have rocked at least those three questions.</p>
<p>If you were playing with friends (of the appropriate age) it would be more of a matter of who could click the buttons the fastest. As you can see in the video the computer is never fast and is drags along before making its choice. It actually would have been difficult to allow the computer to win.</p>
<p>If this is something you missed, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend playing it. The exception would be a drunken evening with friends on who knows the most of about pre-1990 obscure TV shows. Then at least you could have 20-60 minutes of fun before the boredom sets in. If you aren&#8217;t at least in your mid-thirties, you will likely need Wikipedia to help you out. Then again, if you look up all the answers, are you really beating the game.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve now beaten this game I doubt I&#8217;ll ever revisit it. I could play it until I managed to get a shut out on the computer &#8211; but that is maybe one or two more play throughs. As it was I thought it dragged on for what I did play. It&#8217;s an ok trivia game (for its time) but I&#8217;ll just mark this first play-through as a win and move onto something else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/colecovision-press-kit-mouse-trap-full-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95315" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/colecovision-press-kit-mouse-trap-full-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="651" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://duesr.com/?p=563&amp;preview=true">This piece was originally written for Duesr.com</a></p>
<p>Recently I finished <a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/03/06/book-review-ultimate-history-video-games/">The Ultimate History of Video Games</a>. The biggest take away from that was I really need to purchase a Colecovision. I mentioned in the other article about the book that I looked at Colecovision as a nice system, but an also ran. It was a system that didn&#8217;t make it, so why bother. <a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/colecovision-sgm-opcode-1-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95311" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/colecovision-sgm-opcode-1-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="256" /></a><br />
I&#8217;ve relooked at the system thanks to the books and emulation, and now I really want one. I believe a second generation version (Super Colecovision?) could have given the NES a run for its money in the games department. I have a Donkey Kong cartridge for it, but not the system. While I have very limited hands on with a a real Colecovision &#8211; the one game I have spent the most time with was <em>Mouse Trap</em>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mouse Trap was originally an arcade game released in 1981. It was following the rash releases of many maze game clones inspired by the success of Pac-Man. I have never seen Mouse Trap in the wild, maybe when I was five or six when it was first released, but never in any of the retro arcades I have visited. I&#8217;m sure the people who compete for the world championship high score on this cabinet are few and far between. This doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a bad game, it&#8217;s just overshadowed and didn&#8217;t sell in big numbers. This means it was hard to find and few people mastered it.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpaBUAp9r84" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><center><em>Mouse Trap Arcade Gameplay</em></center>As you can see from the arcade version footage above, there is something hollow about the graphics. When you compare to other games of the time such as Pac-Man or Donkey Kong, it comes off as empty. I&#8217;m sure this helped reinforce the idea that it was a Pac-Man rip-off. It wasn&#8217;t though. It had trap doors you could control, it had warp areas &#8211; but you also avoided enemies, ate dots, got power-ups to eat the enemies. With more polish and effort, it truly could have been an evolution of Pac-Man. Sadly the new features dealt with the empty graphics and it is what it is, a footnote in history.</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>In this game you are a mouse trying to avoid six cats wandering the maze. There are doors throughout the maze (the trap portion?) that can be opened and closed by pushing controller buttons. In the center of the screen there is a box (maybe this if the trap portion?) which teleports you to one of the four corners.</p>
<p>If the cats catch you, you lose a life. However, you have a chance to strike back. By collecting dog bones from around the maze &#8211; you can transform into a dog. This allows you eat the cats and remove them from the maze for a short period. There is also a random hawk that tries to eat you.</p>
<p>Ok, just typing out the overview of the game. I agree it&#8217;s silly without much going for it. Let&#8217;s just move on. What I can say is that it was a unique formula where they were trying something new. It almost seems like it&#8217;s a bit complicated overall.</p>
<h2>The Colecovision</h2>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mousetrap-2-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-95316" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mousetrap-2-1-1024x639.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="399" srcset="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mousetrap-2-1-1024x639.jpg 1024w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mousetrap-2-1-300x187.jpg 300w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mousetrap-2-1-768x479.jpg 768w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mousetrap-2-1-1536x959.jpg 1536w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mousetrap-2-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>The Colecovision port was my only real experience with this game. Coleco made its name by getting the exclusive rights for a time period on arcade titles. This became an ongoing issue between Atari and Coleco. I think it all started when Coleco scored up the license to a game called <em>Donkey Kong</em> and included it as a pack-in to the console. It&#8217;s too bad it wasn&#8217;t the <em>Popeye</em> arcade game (<a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/02/27/retrometrics-popeye-nes/">explanation here</a>).</p>
<p>The main difference is that there are only four cats in this game. The video for the Coleco port is below, in it you can see that the graphics are very close to the arcade version. Since I hadn&#8217;t seen the arcade version before, looking at the YouTube video so I could compare them I was actually surprised.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EX34NiJ_cpI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><center><em>Mouse Trap Colecovision Gameplay</em></center>When you are most familiar with Atari, when you see arcade ports, you learn to that there is quite a bit left out. Naturally I assumed this was the case with <em>Mouse Trap</em> also. This is what surprised me, it was very faithful. Almost NES port quality of the early arcade games in terms of presentation. This once again, regardless of how great Mouse Trap really is, shows how the Colecovision shined when porting arcade games.</p>
<p>It should be also be mentioned that Mouse Trap was also ported to the Atari 2600 and the Intellivision. At this time I don&#8217;t know how they compared.</p>
<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p>Even though millions of Colecovision consoles were sold in America, I only knew of one household that had one. That was my cousin&#8217;s house in Michigan. Generally we would make the trip up there for family visits a few times a year. I believe this was before I owned a <a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/03/01/retrometrics-deadly-duck-vic-20/">Vic-20</a> or I had a neighbor with an Atari 2600. Outside of arcades, this was my only access to video games. I anticipated the times of getting to play a home console.</p>
<p>When I was seven or eight only the adults and one of my younger cousins were home. They allowed me to go the basement and play games to occupy my time. I think this was the longest gaming session I had up to this point. It was also all by myself, there was sharing controllers or taking turns. It was gaming nirvana for a pre-teen in the eighties.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember how many games they had, but I flipped through a bunch of them. Obviously I played <em>Donkey Kong</em>, but that was a bit too challenging for me. I was <em>Pac-Man</em> obsessed at that age, but they didn&#8217;t have the <em>Pac-Man</em> port. Cartridge after cartridge to find something interesting and I ended up on <em>Mouse Trap</em>.</p>
<p>It was enough like <em>Pac-Man</em> that 1990-something me would have said that it was my jam. I had to have played this game for a couple of hours before either my cousins came home and distracted me or it was time to leave. For years this game haunted me. I knew it was on Colecovision, but I wasn&#8217;t sure what it was called. When I finally found it I was overjoyed.</p>
<p>After that trip I don&#8217;t remember playing Colecovision over their house anymore. It might have been better things to do. I think my cousins got bored with it much easier than I did. Even if I did play it again, nothing sticks out like that one single day I had the console all to myself.</p>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/d71638a9912a6807e2f436a2c6471ad3-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95318" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/d71638a9912a6807e2f436a2c6471ad3-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="908" /></a></p>
<p>I remember when Coleco ran the promotion that was if bought a Colecovision you would get a Cabbage Patch Kid for free. I attempted to use this as a back door into getting a game console (my brother and I already had Cabbage Patch Kids though). It was unsuccessful. With the Vic-20, I was stuck with it until I managed to buy my own NES.</p>
<p>I have played Mouse Trap on an emulator. I can say without an original Colecovision controller it is a bit difficult using a controller and then tapping the keyboards for numbers. The game doesn&#8217;t grab me like it did my pre-teen self. It was something that was of its era and can&#8217;t be captured again. That&#8217;s a bit sad.</p>
<p>If I ever manage to track down a Colecovision for my own, I think this will be my only story about the system. I could play ROMs and rate them, but it&#8217;s not the same. It&#8217;s an abstract and not a personal experience with the game. So, let&#8217;s all hope I manage to track one down.</p>

<p><a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/03/03/retrometrics-hot-death-uno-windows/">Originally published for Duesr.com</a><br />
Finally we are getting to games that are so much more popular than <a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/02/27/retrometrics-popeye-nes/"><em>Popeye</em></a>. It&#8217;s so much more popular there is even fewer hits for this in Google than there are for <a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/03/01/retrometrics-deadly-duck-vic-20/"><em>Deadly Duck</em></a>. What can I say, I really know how to pick them. I&#8217;m working to make sure that every game I write-up has at least a personal anecdote to go with it. Something to ground them from the past until today. That being said some other choices that almost made the list were <em>Doom 2</em> made my girlfriend break up with me, <em>X-Wing</em> taught me how to break copyright enforcement, or <em>Monopoly</em> for the PC makes the United Nations tame. However, those are now stories for another time. Today is <em>Hot Death Uno</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m almost positive that most the readers finding this page are familiar with how to play <em>Uno</em>. However, if you don&#8217;t I highly suggest you go out now, get at least 2 more friends, and buy a deck. I think your other two friends can teach you, because they already know how to play. Uno is one of those card games that every family seemed to play when I was growing up. My wife&#8217;s family was big into <em>Rummy,</em> well mine was <em>Uno</em> all the way.</p>
<p>When my wife and I had our first townhouse together, we had a standard open door policy to certain friends. That meant that many nights we would stay up late into the night talking, hanging out, and playing games. <em>Uno</em> went on for months and became highly competitive. It got so bad the first part of the game was to strategically remove me from the game in a points perspective so the goal was 1st or 2nd place.</p>
<p>I remember one evening we had a terrible run where there was a blue nine up on the discard pile. No one could play on it for four or five rounds. It mocked us. Eventually we manage to get past it with many more cards in our hands. A few games later in the evening after being mercilessly pummeled by Draw cards on all sides, the one of the others went out. I had about thirty cards still. I was exasperated and paraphrased Shakespeare, shouting &#8220;Blue Nines, on all of your houses&#8221;. That was twenty years ago, it still get&#8217;s quoted among the three of us today.</p>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/download-1-1.jpeg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95246" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/download-1-1.jpeg" alt="" width="370" height="358" /></a></p>
<p>To kill time during the downtime at the computer store I worked at I searched for a copy of <em>Uno</em> to play against the computer. This was the late 1990-something and there wasn&#8217;t many options to play a digital version of <em>Uno</em>. I ran across a <em>Windows 3.x</em> version of Uno called <em>Hot Death Uno</em>. It managed to run on Windows 98, so life was good. The game was crazy. I don&#8217;t mean crazy like last nights episode of <em>The Simpsons</em>. This is crazy like the person you used to date that use as a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://phoneboy.com/hdu">a blog post that explains how to play it with real cards, you can go over the full rules there</a>. While that post explains it fairly well, I think I may have <a href="http://pw1.netcom.com/~dljessup/hotdeath.html" class="broken_link">used these rules</a> or <a href="http://www.oocities.org/hotdeathuno/">these rules</a> when I made my physical deck. We are going to go over the different cards involved. <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15228/hot-death-uno">The images are borrowed from this link</a>.</p>
<h2>Special Card Rules</h2>
<p>Be warned, the cars do you non-politically correct and harsh language. If you are going to make your own deck, click on one of the other links for the points of each card and clarifications for the rules.</p>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428230_md-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-95247" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428230_md-1-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="300" srcset="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428230_md-1-212x300.jpg 212w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428230_md-1.jpg 353w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></a></p>
<p>Double Skip &#8211; This card skips the next two players</p>
<p>Reverse Skip &#8211; This card performs a reverse and a skip at the same time.</p>
<p>Draw 2 Spreader &#8211; This causes all other players to draw two.</p>
<p>Quitter &#8211; Playing this card causes the next person in the round to immediately tally their points and quit the round.</p>
<p>AIDs &#8211; This splits the draw between the person receiving it and the person playing the draw card. So someone playing a draw 4 would draw 2 and the person playing the AIDs card would draw 2.</p>
<p>Luck o&#8217; the Irish &#8211; This card reduces the amount of cards you have to draw by 1 &#8211; so a draw 2 becomes draw 1, a draw 4 becomes a draw 3, etc.</p>
<p>Harvester of Sorrows &#8211; This card actually needs a background. In <em>Hot Death Uno</em> if a Draw 4 is played, the next person has to draw 4 or they can play their own draw 4. This stacks so the next person has to draw 8. This can continue until all draw 4&#8217;s are used, adding 4 more cards to the draw each time. The Harvester of Sorrows negate any further stacking after it is played.</p>
<p>Delayed Blast Draw Four &#8211; This operates as a skip and a draw 4.<br />
<a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428231_md-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-95248" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428231_md-1-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="300" srcset="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428231_md-1-212x300.jpg 212w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428231_md-1.jpg 353w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></a></p>
<p>Holy Defender &#8211; All negative effect cards skip you and are a transferred to the next person in the round.</p>
<p>Glastnost &#8211; If this is played &#8211; the next player must put his cards down on the table for everyone to see for the rest of the hand.</p>
<p>Magic 5 &#8211; This card is a defense card against the Hot Death Wild Card. It can also be played as a wild card, but it only changes the color to red.</p>
<p>Fuck You &#8211; This sends all the effects of a negative card back to the person that played it.</p>
<p>Penn State &#8211; This card is a defense against a Draw 2 spreader &#8211; if shown, it sends the draw 2 spreader to backfire, and that played the spreader must draw 2.</p>
<p>Mystery Draw &#8211; You have to draw the number of cards that this was played on, so if the previous card was a 9, you draw 9. If it was a 1 you draw one.<br />
<a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428229_md-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-95249" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428229_md-1-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="300" srcset="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428229_md-1-212x300.jpg 212w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pic1428229_md-1.jpg 353w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></a></p>
<p>Shitter &#8211; If you have this card you must play it last.</p>
<p>Mad &#8211; If this card is drawn it must be played, choose another player and they are out of the round.</p>
<p>Sixty-Nine &#8211; This card can be played as a 6 or 9.</p>
<p>Hot Death &#8211; This card is a draw 8</p>
<p>Someone attempted to make a modern version of the game (I&#8217;ve heard it exists on Android also). Here is a video of the game play.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t9tqHqWTtt8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Looking at the rules you can see it is significantly easier to play as a computer game. It takes two <em>Uno</em> decks to create your own deck, and everyone at the table has to learn the special rules. It can be painful at first, but then it becomes routine.</p>
<p>I think we played this version at the apartment for a few weeks, but it became painfully slow when a new person joined it. We sat them down at the computer so they could get a background and then handed them the rules. We had to wait for them to properly ramp up to get the game going. Because of this we reverted back to playing standard <em>Uno</em>. However, I&#8217;ll never forget those days.</p>
<p>This little game that someone wrote as a parody has a mild cult following. A few people of heard about this, and I think I covered most the major links about it in this article. I suggest you track it down and try it out. From experience, I suggest you try one of the computer versions before attempting to recruit friends. It&#8217;s easier if it at least one person understands the rules quite well before attempting it with friends.</p>

<p>This post was originally written for Duesr.com</p>
<p>While in the last couple days I&#8217;ve visited known properties such as <a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/02/27/retrometrics-popeye-nes/"><em>Popeye</em></a> and <a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/02/28/retrometrics-magical-copy-baseball-stars-nes/"><em>Baseball Stars</em></a>, today I&#8217;m going to go with a game I spent many hours with. Unfortunately (or likely fortunately) most people have likely never heard of it. This title is <em>Deadly Duck</em>. I had to use the Atari image above because I can&#8217;t seem to find the Vic-20 box art.</p>
<p>Deadly Duck was released for the Atari 2600 originally, but was later ported to the Commodore Vic-20. Looking around online there is little information about this game, so I&#8217;m going to fill you with all I know. Let&#8217;s start to how I managed to come across this title originally.</p>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shatner-vic-201-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95228" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shatner-vic-201-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Back in early 1980-something, I begged my parents for an Atari 2600. Even in my elementary school years I was obsessed with video games. Unfortunately then only access I had to them was at the arcade. My father thought video games were just a waste of time, so he wasn&#8217;t going to get me a console. However, at some point my parents bought into the whole &#8220;your child needs a computer to be apart of the revolution&#8221;. One day they came home with a Commodore Vic-20 and hooked it up to the TV. My digital revolution was getting started.</p>
<p>We followed the manual and did a bit of the programming examples offered. This taught me one thing that I still follow to this day, I did not want to be a programmer. While I finally had a computer and a couple of games &#8211; in the long run it backfired on me. Even a decade later when I wanted a new computer to play with new games, the answer was you already have one. You win some and you lose some. We&#8217;ll just leave it that it didn&#8217;t get much use after I purchased an NES when I was 12.</p>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/vic-20-deadly-duck-sirius_1_381c4d74be19e8285ef1f7fd8703d2cb-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95225" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/vic-20-deadly-duck-sirius_1_381c4d74be19e8285ef1f7fd8703d2cb-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Because Vic-20 software was harder to find than something like Commodore 64 or Apple II, I begged every single time I saw compatible software. The best place to find titles for me was Value City in Elyria, OH. They had a very small computer section, but they carried Vic-20 titles. I&#8217;m sure that <em>Deadly Duck</em> was purchased there. Hidden under a 6-8 foot wide glass case that the clerk had to open up.</p>
<p>Did I know what <em>Deadly Duck</em> was? Nope. Did I care? Nope, it was new software in a time where software was scarce . My other choice was to spend 6 hours typing in a game into the Vic-20 for something new to play. Once again this was just reinforcement to never go into programming. Especially since it would be another 3-4 years before we inherited a tape drive that could actually store software on it.</p>
<p>The <em>Deadly Duck</em> cartridge was shaped differently than the standard Commodore cartridges. Commodore didn&#8217;t enforce the licensing that Nintendo would later do, so anyone could make a cartridge in any shape they wanted. I&#8217;m sure I noticed this back then, but I don&#8217;t think I really cared or understood it.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-JiJ6HRB7k" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Deadly Duck was essentially a Space Invaders clone. There was enemies overhead that dropped bricks. If the bricks hit you, you would die. If they landed in the water, they stopped you from going past them. You could shoot the bricks while they were falling and score points, but more than likely you were only shooting them so you wouldn&#8217;t die.</p>
<p>The game played in a frenzy. It went fast and the game was frantic. I almost think the gameplay video above it the correct speed. You would think that would have been two fast to be acceptable, but it was. Luckily I also had another space invaders clone called <em>Vic Avenger</em>. This was a decent substitute for an actual copy of <em>Space Invaders</em>. <em>Deadly Duck</em> likely would have just had me pine for more authentic game play to the arcade game it is based on.</p>
<p>The best part of the game was every time you shot bullets out of duck-bill, a quack sound effect played. Being somewhere between 6-8 years old, this was awesome. I&#8217;m only assuming there are bullets since the cover art. While he&#8217;s an 8-bit blob on-screen the cover art makes him look like some mallard bionic experiment. It&#8217;s was the 80s &#8211; it was all good.</p>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/archer-super-deluxe-competition-joystick-commodore-64-128-amiga-vic-20-12a8-box-8bfc9956bc181f6e5285bd38e4d1876d-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-95223" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/archer-super-deluxe-competition-joystick-commodore-64-128-amiga-vic-20-12a8-box-8bfc9956bc181f6e5285bd38e4d1876d-1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/archer-super-deluxe-competition-joystick-commodore-64-128-amiga-vic-20-12a8-box-8bfc9956bc181f6e5285bd38e4d1876d-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/archer-super-deluxe-competition-joystick-commodore-64-128-amiga-vic-20-12a8-box-8bfc9956bc181f6e5285bd38e4d1876d-1.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></p>
<p>One of the best things though, my parents bought me a decent joystick. It was identical to the one above. They went above and beyond since they skipped the standard Commodore brand joysticks or a compatible Atari 2600 one. I actually miss this joystick. We went on wild romps together &#8211; quacking, shooting bricks, other stuff.</p>
<p>I actually still own two Vic-20&#8217;s. Unfortunately it&#8217;s not my original system. However, I do have the original box that is over 30 years old. Whenever I see Vic-20&#8217;s for dirt cheap I&#8217;m compelled to pick them up. 30 years later I don&#8217;t have a Commodore 64 or an Apple II &#8211; but I have 2 Vic-20s. I must be a masochist.</p>

<p>This game, it&#8217;s one of the games that I almost wish I could forget about. The first weekend I played it was fantastic, and I&#8217;ll never get back to that again. We will get to the why in a moment.</p>
<p><em>Baseball Stars</em> (<a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/02/27/retrometrics-popeye-nes/">like yesterday&#8217;s piece on Popeye</a>) started out as an arcade cabinet. This is where things get a little weird though. I can find YouTube footage of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSWdOsRoWT0">Baseball Stars Professional</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMpDn_g5uMM">Baseball Stars 2</a> in their arcade incarnations, but not the original. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_Stars">Wikipedia confirms that it started as an arcade before going to the NES though</a>.</p>
<p>Why is this weird? Well no matter how obscure an arcade or console game, I&#8217;ve never been unsuccessful at finding footage. I can&#8217;t even find pictures of the arcade cabinet. If I was little more ambitious I would search if it is available with MAME and try to get footage. I&#8217;m guessing though if I started down that path it would be one of the titles that isn&#8217;t emulated. This must mean that it is obscure as Donkey Kong and not nearly as successful as Popeye was (<a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/02/27/retrometrics-popeye-nes/">read my Popeye piece to understand</a>). It was developed by SNK and to be fair for the NES it was considered a hit game.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t a huge sports game person. Today, every few years I will purchase a year or two old copy of some sports titles for 3.99, but you will never see me paying full price for Madden. So when it comes to baseball games on the NES &#8211; I thought that <em>Bases Loaded</em> was the standard that everything else should be judged. Granted I was a fan of <em>Baseball Simulator 1.000</em> for its wacky gameplay and <em>Base Wars</em> since the robots would fight &#8211; but I wasn&#8217;t an aficionado of the genre by any means.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I think what surprises me is how much I enjoyed this game. Back in 1990-something when I played it, I would have been unaware that it became the standard that other games would be judged (because it was no <em>Bases Loaded</em>).</p>

<p>The first thing it did was install a battery backup. Since many of us had played Legend of Zelda an other battery based games, we were well aware of how it worked. By the time I played Baseball Stars, I would have assumed that most sports games were like this. Obviously I was wrong. So for the competitors, the bases were only loaded while the game was powered on.</p>

<p>The next improvements it did was allow you create players and teams. Back then you had a limited amount of archetypes you could use, but now I see the footage of people scanning their own faces and putting them on the game characters for modern consoles. When you won games you had the option of upgrading attributes on your players. This allowed there to be an RPG element. As you progressed through the season, you leveled up and then destroyed the competition. Maybe they should add a baseball stage to the next Final Fantasy title.</p>

This allowed you to upgrade your team by buying players with better stats than your current ones. It was the cheaper way to max out your characters.</p>
<p>Finally it had a seasons. Seasons that could be stopped between games and saved. You didn&#8217;t have to even play the game, you could set the computer to autoplay the season itself. You could then come back to it later. Combining saved games, seasons, player management &#8211; this are all things you would fully expect of a baseball game today. I doubt you would enjoy one at all that just let you play a single game and didn&#8217;t save any progress on a modern console.</p>

<p>The game was developed by SNK. SNK was primarily a developer for arcade games originally. Success on the NES with titles such as Ikari Warriors had it expand it toes in the idea of home consoles more. They enjoyed this success so much they attempted to go out on their own at one point. They developed a multi cartridge system for their arcade cabinets that allowed them to easily swap out games. They took this system and transformed it into their own console called the Neo Geo.</p>
<p>The Neo Geo was unsuccessful because of the cost of the console and the games. The cost was high because you were literally playing the same game as was in the arcade. There was no best effort reproduction on a ported system &#8211; it was the same game. While the Neo Geo is highly sought after by collectors (I still don&#8217;t own one), those collector pay a high premium. Many of the games go for thousands of dollars today.</p>
<p>With my speculation of is <em>Baseball Stars</em> an arcade game or not aside &#8211; you can get sequels on the Neo Geo. In total the Franchise spawned a total of five titles. I&#8217;ve only played the first one, so I can hope later ones live up to that.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yb9ZF7YaYzY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><center><em>Baseball Stars Gameplay</em></center>Now, why do I curse and love this game? It all happened during my high school years. I was staying the night at a friend’s house. Being standard teenagers in the early nineties we did the normal thing, went down to the store to see if there was a movie or video game to rent. We went to a hole in the wall convenience store in that area of town. They had a couple of racks of movies and video games.</p>
<p>Choosing a rental game would sometimes be tough. You wanted something that you were going to enjoy. It would have to captivate your attention enough that you didn&#8217;t have regret. Sine there were two of us, we wanted something both of us could play. That night we rented <em>Baseball Star</em>s and took it back to his house.</p>

<p>We were playing it for a couple of hours slowly building up our team. I would say we were 4-5 games into the series and then tragedy struck. I don’t remember how, but the NES was knocked off the TV during the middle of a game and the cartridge came loose. We had spent a couple of hours so far in the game and watched what seemed to be tragedy as the NES blinked its red light off an on. It was mocking us in that way of saying “You have wasted more of the last two hours than you thought you did – have a nice life.”</p>
<p>We got up and tried to salvage whatever happened. We reconfigured the NES and re-inserted the cartridge. Luckily the auto-saves included up to the last game we finished. Something else strange happened. The saved game was glitched. It wasn’t glitched in the sense we couldn’t go on – it was one of those times where the game glitches in your favor.</p>

<p>When we went to buy the players we did before the game fell over and we noticed something. We had millions of dollars in the game (why the heck can’t my ATM card glitch this way). This was literally months of work of playing and saving for us done because the game fell over and corrupted the save at just the right spot. There is absolutely no way we could have repeated this. I think this is the only time I have had a game system crash (literally in this sense) in my favor. <a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball-Stars-2017-02-28-15.17.34-1-1.png" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-95216" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball-Stars-2017-02-28-15.17.34-1-300x246.png" alt="" width="300" height="246" srcset="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball-Stars-2017-02-28-15.17.34-1-300x246.png 300w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball-Stars-2017-02-28-15.17.34-1-1024x841.png 1024w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball-Stars-2017-02-28-15.17.34-1-768x631.png 768w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball-Stars-2017-02-28-15.17.34-1-1536x1261.png 1536w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Baseball-Stars-2017-02-28-15.17.34-1-2048x1682.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Of course we were excited, and we immediately purchased every single over the top player that you normally could never afford. Our team was maxed. We went on through how many more games there were in the season and went undefeated. The NES gods smiled down on us in that one perfect moment.</p>
<p>Sadly, I have never brought myself to play that game in cartridge form again. I am next to positive I have a copy in my vintage games collection – but I’m sure if I put the game in my NES I would try to bump and beat the console just right to try to replicate that glitch. Unfortunately I know that can never happen, and I would likely destroy one of my consoles trying.</p>

<p>This was a post <a href="http://duesr.com/index.php/2017/02/27/retrometrics-popeye-nes/">I originally wrote for Duesr.com</a></p>
<p>Ahhhhh &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popeye_(video_game)">Popeye</a> for the Nintendo Entertainment System, it&#8217;s one of the grandpa cartridges from the NES era. When the NES was first launched it North America, Nintendo standardized the packaging design for the first 30 cartridges they published. They had different series lines such as &#8220;action series&#8221;, &#8220;sports series&#8221;, and &#8220;lightgun series&#8221;. Popeye and a few other titles fell under the &#8220;arcade series&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nintendo always had a thing for Popeye. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s something to do with the characters appeal to the Japanese market or just internally to Nintendo, but they always tried to make a Popeye game. Their first attempt was in the 1980-1981 time frame. They had designed this arcade game where Bluto kidnapped Olive Oyl and Popeye had to go rescue her. This involved climbing obstacles, reaching Olive, and then going to the next level to save her again.</p>
<p>Nintendo was unable to procure the licensing for Popeye and had to reskin and adjust the game. The sprites had to be reskinned to bring the game to market. Olive was changed to Lady, Mario to Jumpman (Mario), and Bluto became Donkey Kong. Donkey Kong became one the defacto games of the 80&#8217;s arcade era.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is what became of the first Popeye Prototype</em></p>
<p>Now we all know how much of a tremendous failure Donkey Kong was. It was the game that almost put a nearly hundred year-old company out of business. Most people haven&#8217;t even heard of it today. While Mario escaped to become a megastar, Donkey Kong himself was never heard from again. I&#8217;m sure King Features Syndication was happy to not allow Nintendo to use that license. But, there must have been some sympathy by King Features Syndication, because two years later they allowed Nintendo to try again.</p>
<p>This is the arcade game that everyone remembers. The one that eclipsed Donkey Kong into obscurity. It outshined luminaries such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man. It caused a national shortage on quarters. It&#8230;..well&#8230;.It&#8217;s an ok game. It was a game of mid-level popularity. We know that if the game that became Donkey Kong had been Popeye, Nintendo would be making games such as Popeye Country. Luckily for them in the long run they aren&#8217;t forever linked with Popeye being the mega star.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5Z6PuH4kLQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><center><em>Arcade Gameplay</em></center>To be fair when you look at the graphics from the arcade game footage above, it was a sharp-looking game for its time. It just didn&#8217;t snag those looking to score time on the next mega hit. Honestly, by the time I was old enough to appreciate arcade cabinets and pay attention to them &#8211; I think I may have seen Popeye once. I believe it was in an arcade on the pier in San Francisco. I didn&#8217;t play it though, I dumped quarters into the original Star Wars arcade game.</p>
<p>Popeye has been ported a few times. When Nintendo released the Famicom (the Japanese NES), Popeye was one of the first three games released for the system. Since it was a known brand, an arcade game that I&#8217;m sure people were aware of, and developed in-house. It was a no brainer for the system to be released for Nintendo hardware. Since it had already been ported to the Famicom it was only a repackaging that allowed it to be ready for the North American market.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UNKcl0M7fjE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><center><em>NES Gameplay</em></center>Looking at the NES footage, the graphics are nowhere near as sharp as the Arcade Version. The gameplay is solid though. One thing I&#8217;d like to comment on is that if the game that became Donkey Kong had been Popeye &#8211; the NES character graphics would likely have been very close. I don&#8217;t see Popeye in the NES footage being that much less distinct than Mario in Donkey Kong. It could just be me though.</p>
<p>This game isn&#8217;t something I just pulled out of a hat to discuss though. This game and I have history together. While I did not play the arcade cabinet, I played the hell out of the NES version. This all goes back (to quote the Goldbergs) 1980-something, it was the era of NES and game were expensive. Since most of us could only accumulate a handful game the era of temporarily trading video games was en vogue. So, I didn&#8217;t own the game I managed to score on a lending basis.</p>
<p>My family would take regular trips to visit my family in Greenville, OH. My Godmother and Mother were close so we would visit her every time I visited. I can think of great times hanging out with her son &#8211; watching the premiere of the Thriller Video, taking two dollars up the road to teefers and buying an obscene amount of candy, getting the scar on my chin that is hidden by my beard these days &#8211; you know, the usual childhood best friend that you only see two-three times a year stuff.</p>

<em>Trying Out Popeye Again</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now before you think I&#8217;ve gone off the rails, on one of my visits we were playing video games and we were playing Popeye. For some reason I was completely engrossed in this game. Since Greenville was four hours away from where we lived, I don&#8217;t know if I had planned for a trade and brought something with me. I may have just asked to borrow it. Regardless, Popeye became mine for a time period of three to six months. Since I had already played the hell out of my mediocre collection, this became my game to master for a while.</p>
<p>Since the gameplay is very repetitive (like most arcade games), I remember being quite good at this game. If I would have had a chance back then to translate into arcade prowess &#8211; I may have been middling decent at it. Not &#8220;OMG This is the most amazing player in the arcade&#8221; good, but enough that I wouldn&#8217;t feel embarrassed going around more seasoned players. However, knowing how other things go gamepad skills were a bit different from arcade joystick stills.</p>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6904-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-95189" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6904-1-300x156.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="156" srcset="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6904-1-300x156.jpg 300w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6904-1-1024x534.jpg 1024w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6904-1-768x401.jpg 768w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6904-1-1536x801.jpg 1536w, https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6904-1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>My Actual Cartridge</em></p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t have the same cartridge I spent all those hours on, I do own a copy of Popeye for the NES. It&#8217;s not borrowed, but it is blue. I don&#8217;t love it enough to marry it though. I do think I paid 15.00-20.00 for it when almost all the games I was buying were under the 10.00 mark. It was something that I had spent so much time on that I had to have it my collection. I would love to say that the fact it is sitting above Donkey Kong was intentional. Maybe though, it was my unconscious mind doing that. Knowing they would forever be linked with Popeye being the mega Nintendo hit and you scratching your head going Donkey Who?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/super-mario-land-gb-cover-front-26011-1-1.jpg" class="broken_link"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95150" src="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/super-mario-land-gb-cover-front-26011-1-1.jpg" alt="super-mario-land-gb-cover-front-26011" width="326" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Super Mario Land was one of those games that I never got around to finishing back when it was time appropriate. Back in the 90s when the Gameboy was in style, I didn&#8217;t own one. It&#8217;s amusing since counting different iterations I own about 8 today. That isn&#8217;t to say that I didn&#8217;t have a Gameboy in my possession. We had a great one that we used to broker debts.</p>
<p>I had a friend with a Gameboy and a handful of games. Occasionally he would borrow money from me. Normally this amount was in the $20.00 range or so. When this happened he gave me the Gameboy as collateral. Then eventually I would need money and it swing the other way. While I was responsible for batteries, I definitely got my use out of my time with it. A few occasions it was months at a time. I think I beat a few games on it, but that always annoyed me Super Mario Land.</p>
<p>I had beaten all the Mario Bros. games for the NES, so this should have been a piece of cake. However, even though it was liberal on the extra guys as long as you exited the top door, I couldn&#8217;t lick it. It could have been time, or the running out of battery, but I prefer to think it was because the physic rules were different compared to the NES games. The fireballs would hit the ground in front of you and blast into space. Turtles would explode after you jumped on them. The jumps didn&#8217;t feel solid, but more of a hope and a prayer as the collision detection didn&#8217;t always match up. The fact that there was &#8220;vehicle&#8221; levels that you played like a side scrolling shooter. Whatever the reason it was one of the games that I never finished.</p>
<p>When I first moved in with the woman who would become my life in 1998, she brought a gameboy into the relationship. Originally she also had Super Mario Land, but she had lost it. Mostly we used as a Tetris playing machine. Occasionally we discussed Gameboy games, but it was more my thing than hers. When those discussions arose, there was always some mild complaining about Super Mario Land. Mostly it was lead by me. Super Mario Land 2 was a much more inline with feel to the NES games. The original Super Mario Land would have been perfectly at home on a graphing calculator (which I have seen the ports of and they were near perfect).</p>
<p><a href="https://creeva.github.io/creevacom/2016/07/11/finally-after-over-20-years-i-beat-castlevania/" class="broken_link">Having recently finished Castlevania</a> I thought this would be the next game to tackle. This and the Lost Levels are the only retro side scrolling Mario Bros. game I haven&#8217;t completed. So I fired up the emulator and was prepared to save my game and pound through it. What I found was that it wasn&#8217;t as bad as I remembered. While the quirks I mentioned about the feel no longer exist, the fact that I had a controller and wasn&#8217;t holding a physical Gameboy might have helped out. Whatever the issue, I made it through to the final without much issue. It wasn&#8217;t even until the final boss that I had to load a save state at all.</p>
<p>I think I reloaded the state about 4-5 times. All of those were just figuring out the movement required to beat the second form of the final boss. Then I beat it and saw the end credits. They weren&#8217;t anything special. A small animation and a list of people that worked on the game. It was something that I accomplished and I&#8217;m happy with.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t an overwhelming feeling of joy &#8211; just satisfaction. It was the accomplishment of having beat the game that I wasted hours on during family trips to Greenville. Trying to get jumps correct during the times that random streetlights would brighten the backseat of the car so I could play for a few brief minutes. It was a struggle of first world 90s proportions. Having beaten it like this, and seeing the whole game, I don&#8217;t think I would have a problem these days besting the game on an actual Gameboy. I&#8217;m not sure I actually have the cartridge, but it might be time to start digging for it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been a huge fan of the original Castlevania. From playing a borrowed cartridge on the original NES, to my first steps getting into emulation in the mid-90s, to playing the classic release on the gameboy advanced, back to the original NES cartridge and hardware, to finally using emulation. It was a long journey and one of the games I have spent the most time in an not beaten.</p>
<p>There was always this fascination of the game. I was fantastic at the beginning, but once you get to Frankenstein it was always dicey. So that means the first 1/2 of the game I rocked, and then it always fell apart. I&#8217;ve gotten to Death a few times, but I&#8217;m not sure I ever beat him. That might be stopping point on original hardware. For this run though, I used many save states with emulation. When you lose all of your lives in Castlevania you go back to the beginning. While the beginning is fantastic, there is only so much you can take. It is obviously a winnable game, but it wasn&#8217;t easy. I&#8217;ve been hacking away at it in my free time for the last week. At first I was only saving it when I cleared a level &#8211; then it was when I cleared an area. Finally when I made it to Dracula &#8211; it was many many saves.</p>
<p>Overall there was 65 saves I made throughout the game. Since I did not have re-power up the whip or beat all the levels I already passed when I ran out of lives &#8211; this is truly cheating from the complete experience of Castlevania. However, I didn&#8217;t watch a Youtube video just to watch the credits either. It was still frustrating and tough &#8211; I just used a crutch. I&#8217;m sure many people back in the day say they &#8220;beat&#8221; Castlevania only to have used a Game Genie and cheat codes. This is at least more legitimate than that.</p>
<p>The one thing that will come out of this is a better understanding of the game. Next time I play through it, I won&#8217;t be using save states (and will likely be on a real NES or a Gameboy Advance). I have a grip of what to do and how to handle it. I think my biggest challenge now that I understand how to beat Dracula is handling Death. The sickles are annoying as anything and I think that will be where I get stuck in the future.</p>
<p>While I have beaten many video games in my life, this was one of the few unicorns. Now to tackle those other Unicorns &#8211; TMNT and Mike Tyson&#8217;s Punch-Out.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Image from SWG not the Emu. </em></p>
<p>Last night I received a gift. I was able to play SWG the proper way for the first time since April 2005. That was the date the dreaded combat upgrade went into place. That was the month I stopped being an entertainer (for a while). I left my guild which was originally started to be an entertainer guild. I eventually moved out of the town that I was the first mayor in. April 2005 truly was the beginning of the end.</p>
<p>I will say that I continued to play Star Wars Galaxies off and on over the last six and a half years. On December 15, 2011 the servers went dark for one last time. It was the spark that disappeared from one of the most advanced MMOs that was ever created. Everyone knew about the emulated servers. The last most of us looked they were not in a game worthy state. It just a small place to visit and have small duels. It was not a world we could truly occupy. With the alpha release of the emu, that almost has changed.</p>
<p>I use the term almost because there are still things to work out. There are a handful of professions that still need to be implemented properly. The bazaar terminals are down for another week. The control lag makes things a bit awkward (but I&#8217;m assuming this is because of the popularity). It does however feel like home for the first time.</p>
<p>I think the strangest thing about last night was playing the game in OSX. There never was an OSX client for the official game. The clever hackers at the emu managed to use a Wine wrapper and get the game working perfectly. At first I could only play in windowed mode, but I managed to fix that myself also. Once in the game so many things came flooding back and some were still out of reach.</p>
<p>Our friend Imcus is getting the band back together. He is working through word of mouth of collecting the Star Wars Galaxies Intrepid people. Together we may at least have a home again that we can inhabit or at least visit. He warned us to skip the new player tutorial or we wouldn&#8217;t get our modest stipend.</p>
<p>I recreated Creeva and chose the entertainer profession. This means I got the ugly white outfits with the yellow strips. I also received 1100 credits, a CDEF pistol, a survival knife, and a maroj melon. Then the game told me to go. For those who had never played the game, I will say they would be completely lost. Go? Go where? What do I do? The answer of course is &#8211; whatever you want. Welcome to the sandbox world of gaming.</p>
<p>Do you want combat? You can become a fighting profession. Do you want to make things? You can become a crafter. Do you want to entertain? Then get in the cantina and shake your booty. We don&#8217;t have quest A, then B, then C. We dont&#8217; need them. We have a virtual world with a war going on. We can do whatever we want.</p>
<p>What did I do? Well I knew what I needed. I was already and entertainer, but I also knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. I went to the scout trainer so I could get terrain negotiation. I then went to the marksman trainer so I could start my journey towards rifleman. Then Xie and I headed from Theed to Keren, she needed to track down the brawler trainer. Xie will be the Tera Kasi Artist again, the way she is supposed to be.</p>
<p>We showed up at the shuttleport and bought our tickets to the Keren Starport. We dutifully took our tickets to the protocol droid. He told us there would be a three-minute and forty-one seconds until the shuttle would arrive. How rude! Don&#8217;t they know who I am. When I left the galaxy shuttles would be at my beck and call . We waited and the shuttle arrived. We were on our way to the next town.</p>
<p>While in Keren we decided to go do a mission. We had to remember that we needed to get all the missions (<em>2 per person</em>) in the same direction. We headed out towards the first mission that was 1100 meters away. When we made it within a hundred meters it respawned another 400 meters away. Oh the joy and pain for SWG missions.</p>
<p>We snuck up cautiously over the ridge and saw the beast we had to kill. It was the dreaded Peko Peko birds that haunt the countryside of Naboo. They give children nightmares and share the bones with the gungans. They are nasty creatures. I drew my little CDEF pistol and wished I had a rifle with me. I took aim and shot at the first one.</p>
<p>I hit the Peko Peko and he did not like that. He came right towards me. Xie proceeded to slap him around and call his mother a durni. I just kept shooting. I was running up and down the hill doing my best to not fall to this dangerous beast. Finally he must have been exhausted from chasing me, he laid down and died. Then we took out its dreaded lair. Before the fight was finished we took at least a dozen of those dreaded menaces to be one with the force. We collected our 684 credits and decided to head back to the Starport.</p>
<p>We decided we would head for the largest hive of scum and villainy in the galaxy, Mos Eisley. When we entered the Keren Starport I went straight for the ticket terminal. Xie went to the starship terminal wondering why it wasn&#8217;t working. I gently reminded her that it was part of her previous life, not her new one. We both ran to the starship at top speed so we didn&#8217;t miss our flight.</p>
<p>We arrived in Mos Eisley safe and sound. However, I believe our captain took us through a meteor shower on purpose. Regardless, we could smell the crisp desert air even in the Starport. There were people out front milling about, but we pushed past them and headed to the cantina.</p>
<p>When we entered the cantina it was exciting. There was at least fifty people inside. I setup in the middle of the floor and played that number one hit &#8220;Star Wars 1&#8221;. Who can forget the shrill sounds of a slitherhorn gently putting you to sleep. The blatting overtones were music to everyone&#8217;s ears. Xie danced elegantly and beautifully as always.</p>
<p>After a while I noticed that I was ready to learn some new things. Unfortunately there was no one responding to my requests to be taught. So I kept playing until I had to go to bed. I didn&#8217;t want to go to bed, but unfortunately we are not as young as we used to be.</p>
<p>Before saying goodbye I went to go find a NPC (Nice Person. Cool!). I was hoping I might find a nice CDEF rifle on him, after I lulled him to sleep. I couldn&#8217;t find one anywhere. I did find a nice narglatch with a red sign on him. I thought that meant he was ready to party. I went up to pet him and the next thing I know I awoke in a cloning center. I then logged.</p>
<p>In the past when I switched servers they didn&#8217;t have the feel of Intrepid. I wasn&#8217;t there in the beginning. I&#8217;m now on a server that is just forming. It is going to find its identity and I&#8217;m going to put my little fingerprints in at least part of it. I might even find a home there.</p>
