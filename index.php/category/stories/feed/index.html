I came across one post which was personal, but I just don&#8217;t think I can get into the mindset this particular post needed to continue as it is. This is not a normal thing for me though. I can normally capture the mindset and voice I had at different eras of my life. Granted you don&#8217;t want to see my third-grade writing mindset, I mean it&#8217;s painful. </p> <p>This piece though needed a time, place, and moment to write about it for its particular voice. Anything else is a complete and utter rewrite. So I am working through the thought process of why. I have the same interests, and the same unabashedly sharing of personal stories. The writing in the piece was even fine. So I&#8217;m looking over what part of me has changed. </p> <p>I shared this sentiment with my Facebook friends, in slightly more detail &#8211; but in a more off-the-cuff manner. Writing that I think it&#8217;s the tone that throws me. Because the original article was written in 2016. Between the changes in the world. The changes in society. The changes in the country. It has been so much change. While I feel I&#8217;m the same person, the rotation of the globe has moved me without permission. Which is strange.</p> <p>Nothing is less or more meaningful to me compared to what it was five years ago. I still have the same beliefs neither stronger nor weakened &#8211; but more expressed. This may actually be the key since the writing I was addressing had a key function that dealt with expression. I&#8217;m at a stage for those things that are important need to b expressed differently. This is likely why in the last year I&#8217;ve been writing significantly more again. Obviously not on my website, but significant long-form writing has been done. </p> <p>Between data-basing and cross-referencing everything I&#8217;ve written in my life to working on a project to record each and every childhood story &#8211; it&#8217;s a matter of expression. If we disregard the world and just look at personal changes in my life in the last five years, it&#8217;s been a lot. I don&#8217;t however share what I&#8217;m going through in the present tense. It&#8217;s easier to relay the building blocks from twenty or thirty years ago that echo forth to how I got here. My own therapy. </p> <p>Now some people think we should leave the past in the past. That doesn&#8217;t help you deal with who you are today. Granted at some point every story I tell, it might be the last time. Last week when recording my own personal memories I stumbled across one in the grey matter that I haven&#8217;t thought about in one to two decades at least. It was how I got my blanket when I was two. Now the pathway there was recording other memories and working them out to record a different story. Without chasing it down, that would have been lost. Is it important? No, and at this point, I can tell you the end of my blanket has more to do with my personality than the beginning of it. It was a fantastic memory to revisit though. </p> <p>For those that know me, I obviously have boundaries that I won&#8217;t discuss openly. I&#8217;m open about so much, yet we guard certain aspects that just make us whole as we share most of the pieces with the world. It is how I deal with issues. I take the approach that Mister Rogers gave us growing up. </p> <p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>“Anything that’s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.” &#8211; Fred Rogers. </em></p> <p>Obviously many people didn&#8217;t get that memo. Because they just won&#8217;t talk about their issues in public. They won&#8217;t share random thoughts or deeper meanings. That&#8217;s fine also though, some people are guarded and find their own way to make things manageable. I&#8217;m more personally worried about those that don&#8217;t </p> <p>So here we are talking about things like I always have, on the same subjects I always have. Why does it feel like I&#8217;ve changed? If anything in the last five years (granted on Facebook) &#8211; I&#8217;ve been much more open about things I&#8217;ve gone through growing up. The good things and the bad. I&#8217;ve shared things that some others don&#8217;t discuss. Granted my profile is locked down so it is a fake pseudo-privacy. Yet, I always write so I&#8217;m fine with whatever gets recorded or shared &#8211; I can stand behind it without issues. </p> <p>I don&#8217;t know what it is. But I feel it, I feel that I&#8217;ve stayed the same a very core has shifted. I can contemplate many reasons for this, but nothing definitive that I thought would color my writing. I&#8217;m still the same flawed and optimistic human being that suffers through joy and tragedy &#8211; just a different joy or tragedy of the week. I don&#8217;t know. </p> <p>I just thought like discovering that story from when I was two in my brain that writing all of this out would shake things loose. To help with a self-discovery that I might be missing by letting it stew as words on the page instead. Chasing down the thoughts as they escape out of the fingertips. Here we are, almost a thousand words later, and with no clear answers. Maybe this has helped me and I just don&#8217;t realize it yet. Regardless, I&#8217;m still the same, yet I&#8217;ve changed. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[I know looking at the title you are thinking to yourself, but I just saw Gobstoppers in the candy aisle at the local big box store just the other day.&#160; That these are the Gobstoppers &#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="500" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/61HFRBhoS5L-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-95582" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/61HFRBhoS5L-1.jpg 500w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/61HFRBhoS5L-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/61HFRBhoS5L-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div> <p>I know looking at the title you are thinking to yourself, but I just saw Gobstoppers in the candy aisle at the local big box store just the other day.&nbsp; That these are the Gobstoppers that you remember and have loved your whole life.&nbsp; &nbsp;But that life is a lie.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t mean the crazy-shaped Gobstoppers from the movie that have weird ends coming out of them.&nbsp; &nbsp; Those were never made and sold to the general public &#8211; if a candy version of those were ever made at all.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&#8217;m talking about the Gobstoppers that you could buy in a two-pack for a dime or a quarter (depending on where you got them).</p> <p>You see kids, back in the 80s dime and nickel candy was an actual thing. Sometimes we bought tootsie rolls three for a nickel. Lemon heads and such were a dime a box. And Gobstoppers sat right alongside them in a two-pack. Like many other candies in my young life, I bought Gobstoppers by the truckload. You would buy them and suck on them for 5-10 minutes until you get to that satisfactory moment that you could tell would release the Sweet Tartesque center. It was fantastic.</p> <p>However, those don&#8217;t exist anymore.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Gobstoppers that are sold under the brand name today were originally Gobstopper minis.&nbsp; &nbsp;The new Gobstopper minis the size of a pea would have been considered Gobstopper micro. Part of the Gobstopper legend is how long they lasted, so the current versions actually less than the two packs I used to get. That&#8217;s some false marketing. Another bonus was you could choose which two colors you wanted to start with, which seemed to influence the overall flavor as you could get to the continuing layers below.</p> <p>From a first-hand perspective, I, unfortunately, have a pretty good idea why the original size is no longer available. Choking hazard, plain and simple. Having twice in my elementary school life swallowed an almost full-sized Gobstopper, it wasn&#8217;t a pleasant experience. It was similar to a time I accidentally swallowed a quarter (why did I have a quarter in my mouth &#8211; I was a kid &#8211; who knows). The experience and after-effects were the same. I had some pain and I assume bruising inside my throat. I&#8217;m working under assumptions here since I didn&#8217;t tell my parents &#8211; there wasn&#8217;t a medical diagnosis. The pain lasted a few days though, reminding me to think twice before accidentally doing it again. </p> <p>The one thing to note about all three experiences (quarter, gobstopper x2) is that I applied kid logic to the problem. I was breathing, so I wasn&#8217;t choking. I did freak out because of how the pain was that it might be stuck somewhere between my mouth and stomach. I went into the bathroom and stuck my head under the faucet and started downing as much water as possible to make sure it didn&#8217;t fill up my throat. These incidents were between the ages 6-9 if you were wondering. Why did I use the bathroom sink? Well, otherwise I would have to explain to my parents why I was drinking glass after glass of water all of sudden. The bathroom sink removed those possible questions. </p> <p>Even out of that momentary youthful trauma, I still want the originals back. There are generic ones the same size. Of course, you&#8217;ve always been able to buy the fist-sized jawbreakers that are more of a trophy than an edible treat. None of these experiences are the same, because I was fairly Wonka Candy loyal in my youth. They didn&#8217;t taste the same either. </p> <p>Maybe one day &#8211; some special retro release. </p> <figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

					<description><![CDATA[I have an overall goal of trying to move one laptop over to a terminal-based only laptop one day. However, I can&#8217;t do that until I can survive more than a day or two in &#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="603" height="375" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-03-29_wordgrinder_blog_creeva-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-96109" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-03-29_wordgrinder_blog_creeva-1.png 603w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-03-29_wordgrinder_blog_creeva-1-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></figure></div> <p>I have an overall goal of trying to move one laptop over to a terminal-based only laptop one day. However, I can&#8217;t do that until I can survive more than a day or two in the shell. It&#8217;s not a goal of &#8220;only&#8221; having a system that is GUI-free. I have multiple systems. I just want one singular system that is terminal only and mobile (because I do have multiple headless Raspberry Pis in my environment. </p> <p>So while I can use vi (but really I normally use Nano) &#8211; I wanted something slightly simpler yet more powerful if that makes sense? So I was looking at command line-based word processors and wistfully remembering the ones I loved. My favorite was a dos-based one I used around 1993 or 1994 called &#8220;write&#8221;. Try googling that and finding an accurate result. My next favorite word processor of all time was actually windows-based, Wordperfect 5.1 for Windows 3.1. The Geowrite part of Geoworks (a GUI shell that competed with Windows) was another that was much loved. Other than that it becomes kind of meh, I have no love for other word processor software. Normally I use notepad or whatever plain text GUI equivalent exists for whatever operating system I&#8217;m using. So back to looking. </p> <p> As I said, I do quite a bit with Nano in the command line. For a text editor (not a word processor) I still love editing from DOS, but Nano works very well for my needs. Now the bare minimum has been established, what can I get that&#8217;s a little more? If you ask around online, everyone gives one main example &#8211; Wordgrinder. So since I was just starting out the search, who was I to argue? Sudo apt-get me some Wordgrinder. </p> <p>I fired it up once it was finished and at first I was impressed but did have some annoyances. The first is that I wasn&#8217;t happy with white on black. I decided I wanted to go old school and do bright green text on black, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out how. So I went on Reddit and asked if anyone knew how. Someone was nice enough to answer, they went through the original source code, and there was no option for changing font (or background) colors. What you got was what you get. Not that I&#8217;m ungrateful, but things might still be great (kinda). </p> <p>So color choices aside &#8211; one thing that isn&#8217;t in the image above is there is a top and bottom ribbon (I disabled that). You also can only bring up the menu by hitting escape. However, one thing that psychologically was an issue for me was that typing was always at the middle of the page. You can scroll up or down, but your active data line is in the center. It&#8217;s my issue, not an application issue. I&#8217;m sure I could have gotten over it. </p> <p>I attempted to do my daily journal entry. Writing it in Wordgrinder is easy and smooth. I went back a few times to do later updates before the day ended. Then the problems happened. I had my file named properly with a txt extension. My script pulled it into my daily activity file &#8211; and then there was markup everywhere. Even though I didn&#8217;t have any special markup in my file, the application saved its own anyways. I&#8217;m sure there may be a setting or something I could use to change this behavior, but frankly for my desires and the fact that I was bowled over otherwise &#8211; I&#8217;m moving on. For many, this would be a great program. If you are looking to edit plain text with word processor options &#8211; this isn&#8217;t it. Or it might be just a flag I didn&#8217;t set while starting the program. There is absolutely nothing bad I can say about the program other than no color change and the middle of the screen typing. It just didn&#8217;t fit with my workflow and processing needs. Time to find the next experiment. </p>

If I collected all the data from sources, generated my daily post, and then made notes &#8211; I was leaving out too many details. If I kept a separate file with notes and then pasted it in, that didn&#8217;t help me either. Especially if I&#8217;m away from my computer, I wanted something that I can use from my phone. It was important that it could sync through <a href="http://dropbox.com" data-type="URL" data-id="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> (hence use it anywhere). Finally, it should be saved with plain text or a simple markup where I could script out the extra markup details. </p> <p>At first, I went to the de-facto standard &#8211; Evernote. This is where millions of people make daily notes to organize their lives. It also works with IFTTT, which means I can use Dropbox with it. So I spent an hour testing this solution, unfortunately, Evernote can mark a post as complete before you are done typing. This means IFTTT pulls and processes it before you might be done typing. This is an issue because you may lose relevant data once it enters your workflow. After wiggling and jiggling, dancing and prancing &#8211; anything to try to make this work I gave up. I thought about OneNote &#8211; but it didn&#8217;t work with IFTTT. It also likely would generate too much traffic to offload it to a similar service. </p> <p>To the plain text file, it was. I went through over a dozen free applications. I don&#8217;t want to disparage the fact that the 9.99 text editor for the iPhone may have done exactly what I wanted. I also didn&#8217;t want to pay for something when all I needed was the simplest of editors. Some had to manually sync. Some had a completely intolerable interface. Some advertised functions that weren&#8217;t actually there. I was fed up &#8211; life isn&#8217;t supposed to be this hard for something with two requirements &#8211; plain text and Dropbox. </p> <p>Well, it turns out that Dropbox has a plain text editor built into it. If I specify my save folder &#8211; it even hits my workflows and scripts correctly. I&#8217;ve been using this for the last 4 days, and you know what? It works great. I wasn&#8217;t aware there was a text editor built into the phone app before. That is how you test a simple issue over a dozen different ways and end up with a simpler solution. </p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="365" height="500" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lastblockbuster-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-96099" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lastblockbuster-1.jpg 365w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lastblockbuster-1-219x300.jpg 219w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></figure></div> <p>Last night I finally managed to watch The Last Blockbuster on Netflix. Of course, being the age I am, I have video store nostalgia. I won&#8217;t say that I was a huge fan of the Blockbuster company. I was more of a small video store person. When my family purchased our first VCR a friend of the family gave us a bootleg copy of Gremlins. That movie was watched so many times over and over &#8211; it&#8217;s probably one of my most watched movies that aren&#8217;t in the regular re-watch rotation. The other bootleg we had was Robocop, also watched many times, but not as many <em>Gremlins</em>. </p> <p>Then a video store opened right near our house. A world of movies opened up. Now I know we went there regularly, but not being a family that spent tons of money there &#8211; I&#8217;m going to say it was about once or twice a month. However, there are a couple of specific experiences I remember with the store. The first was when my father allowed my 5-year-old brother (I would have been 10) to rent Rambo First Blood Part 2. That went down as a family legend of a story that managed to get brought up time and time again. There was however no blowback about me, a 10-year-old watching it (because of course my friends had all seen it). In the grand scheme, it was fairly amusing. </p> <p>I do think this whole thing came around because when I was a teenager my father (who once again rented Rambo for a 5-year-old) had an issue with me (once again originally I was a 10-year-old during the Rambo incident) seeing R-rated movies. Down so far that even when I was 15 he had a major issue because I had seen People Under the Stairs at the movie theater, which in all fairness is a fairly soft R mid-budget horror movie. It was, however, the first R-rated movie I saw in the theater. </p> <p>Back on topic though, video stores. The other cherished memory of the video store near our house was when I had chicken pox. The Friday or Saturday of going through infected my parents were going out on the town and my grandparents came over to watch us. As part of this, my parents rented us a couple of movies. While I don&#8217;t remember the second one &#8211; the first was Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark. That movie has since become a constant companion in my life &#8211; and all thanks to that video store. </p> <p>Now in Amherst on Leavitt Road there was another video store near my grandparent&#8217;s house. I refer to this as the &#8220;good video store&#8221;. While the one near me was the size of a cell phone store, this one was about 3-4 times as large. The best part about it &#8211; it had an updated printed pamphlet that listed all the videos in stock. 10 year old me always wondered why they never changed the typo and or why Flash Gordon was listed twice. Right there it is listed as Flash Gordon and beneath it Flesh Gordon, 10 year old me thought this should have been an easy thing to catch and correct. Whenever I managed to twist my parents to go to the good video store &#8211; I looked over that pamphlet on the whole drive over. While it was a much better selection, I had to make sure it wasn&#8217;t something I could have just gotten at the smaller store. I also had to have second, third, fourth, and sometimes fifth choices planned out just in case movies were out of stock. That moment in Clerks where Randall goes to the good video store &#8211; that&#8217;s how 10-year-old me felt going to this one. </p> <p>Then my family moved to Vermilion when I was 12. One of the new experiences was being able to take off on a bike all over the town. Which did mean I go to the local video store (called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Movie House</span>) on my own. It was an interesting mixture. The selection fell more in line with the good video store from Amherst &#8211; but it was the size of the small video store where I lived in Elyria. The best part about the store was that they sold movie posters and cardboard stand-ups once they were done with them. My bedroom was plastered with movie posters from this place &#8211; some movies I hadn&#8217;t even seen like <em>Circuit Man</em> &#8211; the poster was just awesome. There were other places to rent in town, but this was the best place to go. </p> <p>Then as the mid-90s occurred gone were the independent video stores. Chain video stores started creeping in. All those smaller chains mostly were taken over by Blockbuster by the early 00s. The good thing about independent stores was that if you had late fees you could balance them around between stores and decide if it was worth paying back fees to see some new movie. Sometimes you could have late fees at a dozen different stores, but that kind of financial teenage/early twenties juggling disappeared when there was only one business in town. So blockbuster and I played the late fee game and I only caved when I really wanted to watch something. I would pay my late fees and new rental fees &#8211; and start the cycle again. </p> <p>I would say this type of financial irresponsibility lead me to prefer the independent stores, but I played the same game there. I just wasn&#8217;t a fan of the sterility and lack of personality that defined the chain stores. It was what it was. I had an easier time getting a copy of a movie &#8211; at the price of a soul (sorry Blockbuster, just how I feel). I was more likely to go in and buy a used VHS or DVD than I was to actually rent. They became retail outlets for me. I could rent it for 3.00 or own it for 6.00. Factoring in possible late fees, it was mostly cheaper to buy. I ended up owning hundreds of VHS tapes and DVDs. </p> <p>Then along came Netflix, not the streaming Netflix &#8211; the DVD Netflix. We had the 3-movie plan where you could have 3 movies out at any given time. Now knowing that it took about 2 days to get there, I was good at returning them almost immediately after watching by dropping them in the mail. We had new movies 3-4 times a week in the house. Life was good and I paid around 15.00 a month. I was fairly done with renting from blockbuster anymore &#8211; though I still shopped there for used movies from time to time. </p> <p>Of course, by the time Netflix started streaming, I was fairly done with purchasing movies. This was around the same time Blu-Ray arrived on the scene. I do have Blu-Ray movies, but my collection is only about 10% of what my VHS or DVD collections were at their peak. I pay my monthly streaming subscriptions &#8211; paying more a month than I paid for video rentals in the past &#8211; but less than half of what I paid for cable in 2006. For me renting was over (with the exception being the random rent to watch Amazon movies). </p> <p>The documentary though, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it though more for the lost art for the lost mecca of the video store. Blockbuster itself doesn&#8217;t really hold a large nostalgia for me. The celebrity cameos and personal stories were fantastic. If you are looking for video store nostalgia or Blockbuster kicks &#8211; it is definitely worth watching. I think this will be the best of breed on the subject. </p> <p>As the movie was winding down the end of it was finished in 2019. Over the last year of the pandemic and Covid, I had to google. Did the last Blockbuster, the most fragile of creatures, survive 2020? I&#8217;m pleased to announce they did. They also mention this during the end credit clips. One day though, it will close its doors for good. I know another video rental chain in Ohio, Family Video, recently went out of business. I&#8217;m guessing the Blockbuster store in Bend, Oregon may actually end up being more than the last Blockbuster. It may end up being the last member of any video rental chain. It may actually survive long enough to be the last rental store on the planet. </p> <p>Who knows &#8211; but as far as endangered creatures go &#8211; this one is beautiful with its blue and gold plumage. </p> <figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

I do this to the best of my ability since obviously there are some services that you just can&#8217;t get the data out of (at least not on a regular basis &#8211; obviously, some services allow you to bulk export your data and I have tons of that from services in the internet graveyard). So I&#8217;ve always meant to do something with it. I figured way back when I would just script it. </p> <p>Originally it was all on my blog doing a daily dive of all my traffic and generating my lifestream. However, once you stop posting regularly it really gets spammy &#8211; so I stopped. Behind the scenes though &#8211; the spice kept flowing. Flow it did, into tons of files with new information being generated each day. So about three years ago (well, after there was about 14 years&#8217; worth of data I had collected) &#8211; I decided to throw it all into a wiki. Sounds great &#8211; I have plain text &#8211; I can do something with this. </p> <p><strong>The Plan</strong></p> <p>Which wiki to choose though? I was comfortable with Media-wiki &#8211; but similar to just using WordPress, it locks everything up in a database. Now I understand a database can be scripted, adjusted, poked, and prodded. I&#8217;m just not that great with scripting against databases. I have done it &#8211; when I was a consultant I wrote a script that could dump out information from MS-SQL or embedded DB2 databases. I just didn&#8217;t like all my data in a single database file. I would rather lose one than lose them all. </p> <p>This lead me to look for a wiki that had flat files. Optimally the files would be plain text and accessible. After searching I decided upon Dokuwiki. It used plain text files for its pages &#8211; and worked just like a regular wiki from the end-user perspective (syntax differences aside). I installed it. Then I did nothing with it. I then installed it on the home network again. Then I did nothing with it again. This cycle went on for a while. I saved the pages in hopes of building something new from the ashes eventually. </p> <p><strong>Baby Steps</strong></p> <p>Honestly what made Dokuwiki stick was starting to do genealogy. I needed a way to capture documents in a better method than regular software was allowing me to do. I started entering data and formatting it, scrubbing it, tweaking it &#8211; essentially making it mine. Then one day I look up I&#8217;m a regular DokuWiki user. Its regular use was finally ingrained into me. I would check and change things at least weekly. I started migrating some of my documentation over (the kind that can&#8217;t be as easily scripted &#8211; but while we are on the subject, my scripts are in the wiki also). </p> <p>We even had the whole family involved &#8211; well my wife is reticent. She&#8217;s finally seeing the value but is going to host her own version on her own Raspberry Pi. However, my son and I use the home network hosted on a Mac. It even syncs across our machines, so in a pinch offline we can still use it. Maybe that use case will come to pass as we enter the final stretch of the pandemic and finally cross the finish line. </p> <p>So a year later (I mean this is a 14-year journey &#8211; time is meaningless in the vastness of the internet &#8211; it&#8217;s either milliseconds or an eternity) I think &#8220;Huh&#8221; &#8211; you know what would be a great idea. I could use the wiki and actually do something with all that old data I have. I could also generate pages off of my stuff going forward. As I said this to myself, I also remembered that was the whole reason I started this in the first place. It wasn&#8217;t meant for manual data transfer over time. It was meant for up-to-the-day scripted and gathered information. Now how to do it?</p> <p><strong>The Script</strong></p> <p>In theory, I knew what I was going to do. I wrote a MacOS script that parsed data as a customer project before. I&#8217;ve used that as a starting point for other projects. Just a cat cat here and a sed sed there &#8211; here a grep there a grep &#8211; everywhere a grep grep grep. However, the plan is eventually to move this to a Raspberry Pi and have it run on a schedule to grab and sort the data. So that means time to do it on Linux. Because sometimes the quirks between a Linux and Mac script can be painful Thankfully I have both a Mac and Linux laptop. </p> <p>So time to go into Dokuwiki and make a template. I made what I originally considered the end all be for what I needed in a template. Then I configured the script to generate it. Then as I&#8217;m scripting I changed it at least two dozen times. But I finally generated what I thought was a good copy. I copied the file to the directory on the wiki and it worked in the browser without issues. I was like Strong Bad pounding away at the keyboard making it go. </p> <figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure> <p>Because the up-to-the-minute generation of the file would be a pain in the butt, I decided I would use the Yesterday is Today approach. The file would be generated on yesterday&#8217;s data. Then I can add my own personal notes to fill in the gaps. The goal when this is automatic and I&#8217;m not tweaking things at night is to make my notes in the morning. This isn&#8217;t working well right now because I update the final page in the evening (of the day after it occurred). </p> <p>It&#8217;s all working so far, and while I rely heavily on files generated by IFTTT, I hope to work on using more API calls to directly generate the information. That script section will be once everything is working though. It&#8217;s a bigger project of knowledge &#8211; so I&#8217;m on a bicycle version of script writing. It&#8217;s not a motorcycle, but the training wheels are off as I clean up the spaghetti script regularly. </p> <p><strong>The Output</strong></p> <p>Now my daily journal has too much private data for me to share a screenshot of a page. Once I build test data (which I started yesterday) &#8211; where I can check everything and how it looks, you&#8217;ll just have to read. </p> <p>The top of the page has the journal date a fancy graphic, and navigation to the journal archive &#8211; archive by year &#8211; archive of the current month &#8211; yesterday and tomorrow.

<h2>About DM Cruelty</h2>
<p>There are times when you can just be cruel as a DM. &nbsp; This isn&#8217;t about the scenarios where you make elaborate traps to either kill or dissuade your party into following the line you have made. &nbsp;This is solely the fact that you take petty revenge that makes no sense in the mechanics of the game. &nbsp;As long as it isn&#8217;t a constant every time you play with that type of behavior, it doesn&#8217;t make you a bad DM. &nbsp;It does however show that you are having a tantrum because it is a game where people think and follow their desires. &nbsp; You can set up the stage however you like, it doesn&#8217;t mean players will follow. Over the years I&#8217;ve played with quite a few DMs in different games. &nbsp; Some were good, some were bad, and some were cruel. &nbsp; I&#8217;m more freeform when I run a game. &nbsp; I have a couple of things that may or may not happen, but I&#8217;m ready to just go off on the fly. &nbsp; The reason I run games this way is that most of the DMs I have played with have taught me that the game is an adversarial process and not a collaborative one. It becomes a chess match between the player and the person running the game. &nbsp; This has turned into a game where the DM must control the players and the players attempt to do things that the DM doesn&#8217;t want them to. &nbsp; It becomes game theory where the players are working together to win a game that the DM isn&#8217;t quite sure he is playing. &nbsp; They are doing this trying to follow the constraints that the DM has put forth. &nbsp; The DM on the other hand is trying to tell a story in a grand sweeping world, however, what he wants to do is run it like a dungeon crawl. &nbsp;If they wanted a dungeon crawl, they shouldn&#8217;t open up other options. I&#8217;m doing this in a multi-part post to go over some of the cruelties I have dealt with playing roleplaying games. &nbsp; Maybe you&#8217;ll be inspired to be better, or maybe you&#8217;ll have no ideas to be crueler. &nbsp; To be fair, it really matters what works for your gaming group. &nbsp;Different people need to be handled in different ways. &nbsp; When you start a new group though, you can steer how the game is going to be played in the long run. &nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to steer the direction a different way once things are in motion.</p>
<h2>The Laser From Orbit</h2>
<p>We all have gaming sessions that we remember years and decades later (for those under 20, the decades will come eventually). &nbsp; There is one session that I complain about. &nbsp;It happened around 1996 and we were playing Top Secret SI late into the night. In the game Top Secret SI you play as a James Bond Spy type. &nbsp;There is a good spy organization and an evil one. &nbsp; We always played as the good guys trying to destroy the evil Web organization. &nbsp; Just like Bond though, quite a few of our missions didn&#8217;t revolve around the opposing organization at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;We had many side missions that went off and just saved the world. Instead of something like a D20 system or classic Dungeons and Dragons THAC0, Top Secret SI used a percentage system. &nbsp; So if you had a 5% chance of shooting a guy, you better roll a 5 or less on 2 d10s. &nbsp;If you have a 95% chance of doing something, roll a 95 or less. &nbsp; For someone starting out this game is a piece of cake to understand. &nbsp; It was one of the first RPGs I mastered. &nbsp; It seemed so much easier than Rifts which I had played a few times before. &nbsp;We had regular gaming sessions and the storylines were enjoyable. One day after the main mission had been taken off a co-conspirator and I decided we were going to do a get-rich-quick scheme in the game. &nbsp;While we were always looking for an angle, there was something in the mission that triggered this. &nbsp;I wish I could remember what the original mission was. We were on our side of the table sketching out a scheme that basically was a Salami Attack. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t know it had a term back then, but a Salami Attack is where you take pennies or fractions of pennies from thousands or millions of accounts. &nbsp; The goal is that these small amounts will go unnoticed and be considered rounding errors. &nbsp; The account that receives this money will have an aggregate amount that leads up to a large mass. &nbsp;While I may have read something similar before I did this, when I worked it out, it was a textbook example of the attack. When we did our write-up to explain to the DM we took the rounding error method in the electric company&#8217;s billing practices. &nbsp; At the end of the day, it would take any percentage of a penny ($0.009999999 or less) and put those fractions into an account. &nbsp;The plan was to have this as a reoccurring program that would run for a few months and trust fill up the bank account. &nbsp;I would say my co-conspirator and I laid all this out in about 15 minutes. The DM was going to make us roll for it. &nbsp; This was fine since my character had been built with very high computer skills. &nbsp; However, during each stage of the plan, the DM required us to roll the dice. &nbsp; I think we went through at least 20 rolls on this. &nbsp;The DM was really hoping that I would fail at some step just so he could put an end to this nonsense. &nbsp;Unfortunately for him, I aced every single one of the rolls. &nbsp;The plan kept progressing. At this point, of course, we still do not trust the DM. &nbsp; To make sure we crossed the T&#8217;s and dotted the I&#8217;s our characters went through and double-checked everything. &nbsp; This in turn caused us to go through all the rolls again. &nbsp;We had written this process up as a very tight process that the DM didn&#8217;t have much wiggle room. &nbsp; He had agreed it was solid and should work if my dice rolls were successful before we started this whole evening of skill checks. The process was laid out, the program was written, and there was only one thing left to do &#8211; run the program. &nbsp; I announced that I was starting the program and hitting enter. &nbsp; Then a satellite in orbit above the earth shot down a laser. &nbsp;This blew up the warehouse where my co-conspirator and I had been. The DM used this point to explain to us that we weren&#8217;t away from the detection capabilities of the US government and we triggered an automatic defense mechanism. &nbsp;This is what caused us to blow up. &nbsp;Being in the IT field, I knew we didn&#8217;t have these capabilities. &nbsp; When I worked at NASA a decade later we didn&#8217;t have any sort of laser defense as an auxiliary attack if our IT infrastructure was compromised. &nbsp; It was just him going along and wasting hours of everyone&#8217;s time to use his hand of god to show you can&#8217;t win.</p>
<h2>Why Was This Cruel?</h2>
<p>We can use this as an example of how to make your players follow the path. &nbsp;However, there were much better ways to handle the scenario. &nbsp;The internet could have gone out, bad guys could have set up a drug meeting in the building we were attempting this from, the fact that it ran successfully for a week and then was discovered. &nbsp;If we had netted a small amount from it, that would be fine and fair for the amount of work we put into it. The DM just wanted to apply his superiority to the situation. &nbsp; Money was meaningless in the game. My character was a millionaire through family money. &nbsp;I think most of the other players were rich over time. &nbsp; Our organization would give us whatever we needed, so money wasn&#8217;t an obstacle the DM was using within the game anyways. &nbsp;If it had been, this would be a different issue. &nbsp;Money was really meaningless. Since there would be no tangible gain for the characters that would adjust the plot. &nbsp; That is what makes this cruel. &nbsp; It could have been this interesting side evening game where the DM made all these logic traps to stop us and we rolled the checks to get by, but instead of a mental dungeon crawl &#8211; it was just wasting time. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why it is cruel. Next time I do one of these articles, I&#8217;m going to talk about how a DM killed everyone because they had prior real life commitments.</p>

It&#8217;s a wonderful feeling and the only thing missing is an alcoholic drink in my hands. Don&#8217;t I wish? What I am doing is looking at my pet projects, or like I call them the fever of the minute things I need to get done. I still have family pictures to scan and return. I went white-hot on genealogy research for a few weeks last year and need to get back on that. I received a new 3DS for Christmas and I&#8217;m back on heavier gaming (Legend of Zelda &#8211; Link Between Worlds is awesome). I need to actually write something and get it on my site&#8230;..wait I&#8217;m doing that now. Disregard that last statement. It seems that we all deal with the struggle of the time. As you are young time seems infinite. These days it seems that there is only a single month in the year. I go to any of my tasks and think, I will get to that in a couple of days. I look up and it&#8217;s been six months and I can&#8217;t fathom how I didn&#8217;t get it done. I&#8217;m lucky my Christmas lights are down thanks to a break in the weather the first week of January. However, I did miss a couple of strands on a tree in the front yard &#8211; so they aren&#8217;t all down, but should be when I&#8217;m home and the weather isn&#8217;t snow drenched. To top it off, my son is disappointed that my 3DS can&#8217;t connect to my hotel wi-fi. He was hoping he could play Mario Kart with me when I was on the road. Next trip out I&#8217;ll have a wifi adapter packed so I can turn my machine into a hot spot. I just wanted to vent. I hope you enjoy the picture of the A-Team van I found in Omaha Nebraska. Back to it&#8230;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95421" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/61aNSE-F9L._SL1000_-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/61aNSE-F9L._SL1000_-1.jpg 1000w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/61aNSE-F9L._SL1000_-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/61aNSE-F9L._SL1000_-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/61aNSE-F9L._SL1000_-1-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /> Like half of America, I made a purchase yesterday that threw me into the Amazon ecosystem. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be the proud owner of a couple of Amazon Echo devices. One thing that really interested me was the ability to extend the system. With Siri, I managed to a raspberry pi and control my lights via voice, but the further extension was doable &#8211; but painful. I wasn&#8217;t positive about what I was going to do with it at first beyond the simple things. So, like any good geek, I started to research. Since there is an Alexa App built into the Amazon IOS app, I started playing around with a few things. The one thing I can say I&#8217;m disappointed with is that I need to allow internet access to my plex server if I wanted to control that. That scenario is out. So at present time streaming easily from iTunes. However, I did get my lights working and controlled via voice. There was a bit of trial and error since I&#8217;m new to the setup, but first-timers without having done things many different ways, shouldn&#8217;t have any issues. This leads up to my love of ifttt and the fact that I still run tons of desktop utilities. Since many utilities run on remote servers, I normally log in remotely and trigger them manually. I thought it would be great to get a couple of these working with Alexa. However, there seem to be many options to do this. Many are convoluted so, while mine is simple to me, it may not be the best for you. To start with you need an Alexa device (mine was my iPhone) and have it connected to <a href="https://ifttt.com/">Ifttt </a>(If This Then That). The next thing you need is a dropbox account (or any other cloud storage provider supported by Ifttt). So what I did was create a new ifttt applet that runs when I tell Alexa &#8220;trigger network backup&#8221;. This applet creates a file in dropbox called runme.txt. I created a scheduled task that runs a vbs script. This script is solely so I can run a batch file silently. You can run the batch file directly &#8211; but you will get the annoying cmd pop-up. The batch file that is called by the scheduled task as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>@echo off del c:\scripts\ifttt\ifttt.bat type c:\users\me\dropbox\ifttt\runme.txt &gt;c:\scripts\ifttt\ifttt.bat del c:\users\me\dropbox\ifttt\runme.txt c:\scripts\ifttt\ifttt.bat del c:\scripts\ifttt\ifttt.bat</p></blockquote>
<p>In case of reboots or hangs I have the running batch file deleted. This runs as a scheduled task that kicks off every 5 minutes. So my commands are delayed, but it required the bare minimum of system resources and auxiliary software. I may change to a more instant method in the future. When I set up a specific trigger on Ifttt the contents of runme.txt have the path to the batch file I want to run. So if I say &#8220;trigger network backup&#8221;, ifttt looks at the applet, it then makes the runme.txt file with the contents being c:\scripts\backup.bat. When this runs it kicks off a robocopy job that mirrors my servers. I can also make a trigger back that alerts me when a job is done. As I create more scripts or logic to run I can do this for many other tasks in the future. I&#8217;ll be able to trigger jobs on different systems by changing a different machine to watch for runme2.txt, runme3.txt, etc. It&#8217;s simple and efficient. Now, if only I could rename the wake word of the echo to Jane&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96104" src="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/typewriter-1.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/typewriter-1.jpg 960w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/typewriter-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://creeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/typewriter-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /> I have a few friends that like the minimalistic lifestyle. Believe it or not, so do I. Obviously, if you looked into my office, you would go &#8220;Oh My God, you are a hoarder&#8221;. I don&#8217;t deny that at all, but at some point, there is a difference between artifacts and &#8220;stuff&#8221;. Let&#8217;s get some things clear. There are items I own that can be considered stuff. It is stuff I love, old video games, a couple of ancient computers that I acquired later in life, game systems, Lego, and books. Fair enough this is all stuff. It&#8217;s stuff that maintains my sanity. Not all of that &#8220;stuff&#8221; is &#8220;stuff&#8221;. Some of the items are artifacts. The bulk of it is stuff though, so it gets lumped in. Now let&#8217;s look at artifacts. I have my first teddy bear, LPs that are scratched up &#8211; but they were scratched by me before I was 6, a centerpiece from my prom, and hundreds of knick-knacks that I could write personal memories about. How do you separate those things? You see a figure of Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. I see a birthday gift given to me on my sixteenth birthday and the mascot of my only entry into the crazy craft race in Vermilion. He was tied to the front of the boat and we won second place in creative design. Tucked away in a tote with ancient writing that spans three and half decades of my writing &#8211; there is a small container with my baby teeth. Did I save them? No, but they were given to me for some reason when I turned 18. I thought about throwing them away because it is a bit creepy. However, they are a part (or were a part) of me. There is a reason they are tucked away in a tote and not on display &#8211; because again, creepy. My minimalistic friends would throw away all of their artifacts. They want to live lean and nimble. I can assure you that everything I would need in this world would fit in one car. This is my threshold &#8211; if it can&#8217;t fit in a single car then it&#8217;s too much. Granted my IROC doesn&#8217;t run and I can&#8217;t part with it &#8211; so it borders stuff and artifact. If it was running though, all my important things could fit into it with 1-2 passengers beyond myself. My office and my wife&#8217;s library are starkly different. My office is organized madness with artifacts showing my mind in an open way. Her room is stark, where the clutter is books piled here and there. It looks nice and she needs a meditative place to work. I on the other hand need inspiration around me. They are triggers that put me into the right space. Neither is right nor wrong. While I won&#8217;t lie and say my room is always organized &#8211; it isn&#8217;t. Funny enough it&#8217;s my actual work and temporary things that cause the mess. It&#8217;s rarely my stuff or artifacts. Those almost always have a place. I&#8217;m writing this as I&#8217;ve been working on reorganizing my office. Toys are being hung on the wall and moved from shelves. This is more because I need the shelf space. The shelves are/were too cluttered. However, as you enter my room it looks like pop culture vomited over everything. It&#8217;s only going to get worse for some (better for me). I don&#8217;t want to look at a single spot in my office and be uninspired. What is my point in all this? Well, the things I own are an extension of me. There are all things I can regale tales about, in fact, I have thought about trying to write about everything in my office. There are so many anecdotes to write about and so little time. I don&#8217;t go out and buy the latest action figures &#8211; all in comparison to most geeks I buy very little stuff. The goal is to razor-sharpen what I own to be more &#8220;me&#8221;. It&#8217;s not about who owns the most, it&#8217;s about what you own that defines you in the best proper way. Not in the way to impress others, not in who has the most toys, not in the way of owning it just because &#8211; the stuff you own should make you a better you. That makes it artifacts and not stuff. If it&#8217;s not important, then is nothing more than stuff. Don&#8217;t be minimalistic for the sake of being minimalistic, be who you are and be defined by that which surrounds you.</p>
