Today&#8217;s thought &#8211; in a decade I&#8217;ll be the same age as my Grandfather was when I was born. \u00a0That my son has lived in the same house all of his life, but by the time I had been his age I lived in four different places. \u00a0 It makes me maddening sometime.<\/p>\n<p>The real reason these are pointless, they all making me think momentarily that I am old. \u00a0 I am not. \u00a0I&#8217;ll even argue that with the aches and pains that body routinely goes through. \u00a0I wrote in the past that my generation is the one that doesn&#8217;t grow up. \u00a0 We also are refusing to get old. \u00a0 I can hear you in your head now, he is only saying that because he is old. \u00a0 I offer for evidence\u00a0Wilfred Brimley. \u00a0Mr. Brimley was fifty-one\u00a0when he was in Cocoon, I&#8217;m not going to look like that when I&#8217;m fifty-one\u00a0in twelve years. \u00a0 In case you are wondering Steve Gutenberg was twenty-seven in the film. \u00a0 The whole point of the movie are a bunch of old people that are trying rediscover youth. \u00a0Steve Gutenberg played the guy that thought they were cute and they were going to break a hip. \u00a0I guarantee my peer group is not going to be in the retirement in our fifties.<\/p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t say we look young &#8211; but we look at least a decade younger than our parents did at the same age. \u00a0 I&#8217;m also assuming our parents look a decade younger than their parents. \u00a0 When we hear the stories of how Noah lived into his nine hundredth year, he really was thirty-seven and just looked nine hundred. \u00a0If I was more vain I could pass for younger. \u00a0I could get rid of my premature gray hair. \u00a0I could shave my face. \u00a0 Both those things could remove five to ten years of aging. \u00a0I just don&#8217;t care. \u00a0It&#8217;s the thought that in twenty years we have moved from beepers being a cool new thing with a touch screen digital communication device in my pocket that is given away with service contracts. \u00a0 It is insane.<\/p>\n<p>We have the other meaningless time devices that do scare us as we get older. \u00a0 When I&#8217;m the same age as my grandmother passed away (fifty-six) I might be looking at my mortality at the first time. \u00a0 After that it will be ages where I have lived longer than someone else. \u00a0 This is a meaningless milestone that is unimportant. \u00a0We already track the milestone of &#8220;you didn&#8217;t die yet&#8221; &#8211; we call that a birthday. \u00a0 We can calculate to the minute of how old we are. \u00a0 We could say the second, but birth records are not that precise yet. \u00a0 Every breath is another that is meaningless to compare to someone else&#8217;s. \u00a0We are all different, so why would we think our lifetime would be of equal length or even comparable.<\/p>\n<p>These are the thoughts that go through my brain on a regular basis. \u00a0 Are these thoughts important in the grand scheme, no they are meaningless. \u00a0I guess I&#8217;m stopping now, otherwise I&#8217;ll just keep rambling further and further about the passage of time. \u00a0 All the while I will be wasting yours.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Milestones are how we mark certain aspects of our lives that meaning. \u00a0 Some are meaningful and some are meaningless. \u00a0 A perfect example of important milestones are the ones associating with growing up. \u00a0 &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94832,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94831"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=94831"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94831\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94832"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=94831"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=94831"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=94831"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
