Timeline Is Not Completely Rolled Out Yet?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Today I saw more complaints about Facebook moving people to timeline. \u00a0 The strange thing I originally thought that the roll-out was supposed to be complete in Spring of this year. \u00a0 It is strange that everyone doesn&#8217;t already have it already. \u00a0I snuck into testing with the developer preview hack last September, so it is old news to me.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll start with the fact that I like timeline. \u00a0 I have more concern about the news feed and not seeing everyone&#8217;s stories. \u00a0 Timeline gives me a simple chronological design that let&#8217;s me dig into my past. \u00a0I&#8217;m huge into lifestreaming, so I love this. \u00a0 I also like the polished design.<\/p>\n<p>Timeline (from my understanding) uses a simpler code base. \u00a0 This allows Facebook to be more agile in their development. \u00a0 Trying to save both the old and the new can cause all kinds of problems. \u00a0Maintaining two code bases greatly increases your exposure to be vulnerable to outside attacks. \u00a0 Trying to support legacy code and make it work with new functions often exposes security risks themselves. \u00a0 You can view any Microsoft exploit which was introduced two versions of Windows earlier, but was left in for\u00a0compatibility. \u00a0This isn&#8217;t uncommon.<\/p>\n<p>We do have people who think it isn&#8217;t a big deal if their Facebook gets hacked or lose their online information. \u00a0 That Facebook is just a silly thing online to pass the time. \u00a0For anyone that thinks losing one account isn&#8217;t a big deal, please <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/gadgetlab\/2012\/08\/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking\/\">read Mat Honan&#8217;s piece at Wired about the hack he suffered through last weekend<\/a>. \u00a0 You also are not doing any of your friends any favors if your account suffers a hack. \u00a0 Too many Facebook exploits are passed through social connections.<\/p>\n<p>If we move past the security concerns that arise from never moving forward and refining, we can get to bottom line cost. \u00a0 The old Facebook had a legacy code system that started in 2004. \u00a0 Then feature after feature, cruft after cruft was heaped into the existing code base. \u00a0 While Facebook has a fail often and work with live code approach, this just can make things worse over time. \u00a0Timeline was their chance to break free of this old buggy code. \u00a0 This comes at the expense of programmer&#8217;s salaries and other operational costs. \u00a0Running\u00a0parallel systems must be costing Facebook millions.<\/p>\n<p>This money can be form salaries, operational costs because it requires more server power, the amount of servers needed, auditing costs, and etc. \u00a0 Running something the size and breadth of Facebook is not cheap. \u00a0 They may have a small number of employees, but this just makes them more agile in the marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>As with any change with Facebook there is security concerns. \u00a0 You have to make sure your privacy is set up properly. \u00a0There are many guides out there explaining all the security settings. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not going to rehash this here. \u00a0Google can be your best friend in this area.<\/p>\n<p>All the items are things I submitted to\u00a0Facebook. \u00a0That point is important because many people over the last year were bothered by the information that was on their timeline. \u00a0 Just because the data wasn&#8217;t easily accessible by your friends, doesn&#8217;t mean it wasn&#8217;t accessible. \u00a0 I may have known things you had your Facebook profile that you had long forgotten were there. \u00a0 Regardless, this information was always accessible and viewable. \u00a0 The fact that timeline makes it easier to skim through doesn&#8217;t change that fact.<\/p>\n<p>I know people who are afraid what their relatives might think because of something they posted. \u00a0I know people in their thirties and forties that still hide stuff from their parents. \u00a0This is insane to me. \u00a0If you can&#8217;t admit who you are to your family, you have issues. \u00a0 I have a couple blocks on certain items for work associates, but that&#8217;s it. \u00a0 Everything else is open to everyone on my friend&#8217;s list.<\/p>\n<p>From a user perspective, there isn&#8217;t much new functionality. \u00a0It is the\u00a0same\u00a0functions wrapped in a new shiny skin. \u00a0 Sometimes we really have to let go of the old so we can move forward. \u00a0 This is especially true when it comes to software. \u00a0 \u00a0That&#8217;s all Facebook is, a piece of software. \u00a0 It&#8217;s hosted on a website and run through your browser. \u00a0 Wouldn&#8217;t you like the version that is the least buggy and most secure?<\/p>\n<p>If this was truly a bad decision, the Facebook active user count would be shrinking. \u00a0 It actually has been growing faster since timeline was implemented. \u00a0 From a business decision it seems Facebook made the correct one. \u00a0I&#8217;m not going to argue that some users have a certain aesthetic they like, but that comes at a cost that Facebook isn&#8217;t willing to bear at this time. \u00a0 You are welcome to try other social networks. \u00a0 In theory. if enough people moved over, this would be the time that <a href=\"http:\/\/plus.google.com\">Google Plus<\/a> could gain traction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
