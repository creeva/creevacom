I do however suspect parents have a favorite child. If not a direct favorite, at least a favorite to do certain things with. My parents were no different. I could pull out favoritism on my father&#8217;s side, but that doesn&#8217;t matter, when that was evident and apparent I didn&#8217;t like him very much. My mother on the other hand is what this piece is really about anyways.<\/p>\n<p>My mother&#8217;s favorite child was either the trophy child or the youngest child. Sometimes they were the same child, other times they weren&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not going to say I was never the favorite child, I was quite a bit. i was the oldest child of her six, so being the first I&#8217;m sure she always had a bit of pride in me (of course now that this web series has ran&#8230;.). But like most families the youngest child, the baby of the family, was always doted upon quite a bit. As far as i can remember I never minded, so that never bothered me.<\/p>\n<p>The trophy child on the other hand was my brother immediately behind me. He was as spoiled as my youngest brother. He seems to have turned out just find, though a strong sibling rivalry is still there. Now I&#8217;m sure the question s why is he the trophy child. Well at one point he decided that he wanted to live with my father.\u00a0 This was all well and good and lasted a few months (year?).\u00a0 Until he started getting disciplined.<\/p>\n<p>On a weekend visit to my mother, my brother just didn&#8217;t go back to my fathers.\u00a0\u00a0 My father didn&#8217;t fight custody over the matter, if my brother wanted to live with my mother, so be it.\u00a0\u00a0 The key is that my brother had hardly any rules placed upon him.\u00a0 He was the biggest wild child of all of us.\u00a0 That doesn&#8217;t make him a bad person, he seems to have turned out alright.\u00a0\u00a0 I don&#8217;t care that I had more rules placed upon me, I&#8217;m the oldest, it&#8217;s my job to take the brunt of everything.\u00a0 I&#8217;m perfectly fine with that.\u00a0\u00a0 Maybe that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so accepting of life now.<\/p>\n<p>My brother got away with this because back in my mother&#8217;s brain, if she didn&#8217;t indulge him, then she would loose him again to my father.\u00a0\u00a0 My father and brother were very close when he was younger, this was my mother&#8217;s way to split a wedge in there.\u00a0\u00a0 It took years for my brother to talk to my father again, a lot of this is because of the poisoning that my mother had done.\u00a0\u00a0 He was her trophy over my father and she wasn&#8217;t going to let go of that.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m sure he doesn&#8217;t look at it that way, or is even aware of it.<\/p>\n<p>My sisters on the other hand got both the poisoning against my father (it didn&#8217;t take) and none of the perks.\u00a0\u00a0 Even a decade after my brother had left the house, my sister (from the same father) had a much harder time and more rules placed on her then any of hte rest of us had.\u00a0\u00a0 She was actively disciplined, yelled at, and talked down to.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m sure my youngest brother won&#8217;t ever go through and be treated that way.\u00a0 He&#8217;ll be coddled and spoiled, and probably living with my mother until he&#8217;s thirty, or at least until he wises up.<\/p>\n<p>In the end it works out though, my brother can do no wrong in my mothers eyes (heck she even drank with him underage).\u00a0 She has the same blinders towards him that her parents have towards her.\u00a0\u00a0 He gives her love, he doesn&#8217;t question her, he doesn&#8217;t push her to be a\u00a0 better person.\u00a0 Since they view the world in similar ways and there is no tension between them, he has become her perfect child.  During my mother&#8217;s latest separation my brother even told my father that she didn&#8217;t have to worry because we&#8217;d take care of her.   I&#8217;m not sure where this &#8220;we&#8221; comes from.   Never was I going to financially support my mother, even when we were getting along.<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 2 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 3 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 4 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 5 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 6 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 7 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 8 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don&#8217;t have my child yet, let alone more then one.
