I couldn&#8217;t throw it out. \u00a0It had a music box that calmed infant and toddler me to sleep. \u00a0 I tried to go through old pictures but none of them seemed to have a picture of me with that bear.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing I was around five or six years old. \u00a0 I&#8217;m fairly certain of that since I&#8217;m 99% sure that my brother was around. \u00a0 I seem to be remember his wooden rocking horse in the room witnessing that whole thing. \u00a0 My brother was likely in the playpen with the fold down sides. \u00a0It was yellow with a zoo animal print covering the metal and white netting to contain the child within. \u00a0 I only remember it so well since it was originally mine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This was the design, but I think the pattern was different<\/em><\/p>\n<p>My grandparents (Gee and Pa) were over babysitting my brother and I. \u00a0 \u00a0I was being a normal five or six year old and not listening. \u00a0 I was running around playing with my best friend the teddy bear. \u00a0 We were running through the kitchen loop in the condo. \u00a0 We were going up and down the stairs. \u00a0 We were flying through the air. \u00a0 At the point the teddy bear was flying through the air I was told to stop that. \u00a0 Gee obviously saw the possible complication coming. \u00a0 I waited until she left the room to make some food in the kitchen &#8211; and then I continued anyway.<\/p>\n<p>I was tossing the bear into the air almost hitting the ceiling. \u00a0 I would catch him on the way down. \u00a0 Likely I was mimicking how my dad would throw my brother or I into the air. \u00a0 It was all fun. \u00a0 Fun and games until I misjudged either my throw or my catch. \u00a0 The bear, with the built-in wind-up music box, came crashing down on my head. \u00a0My first instinct was to cry, but I knew that would only alert my Gee. \u00a0 This would also mean I would likely get some scolding or punishment. \u00a0 I choked the tears down. \u00a0 I reached up to feel the bump on my head. \u00a0It was wet. \u00a0 I looked at my fingers and there was blood on them. \u00a0It always it fun and games until someone gets hurt. \u00a0 Then it isn&#8217;t so fun anymore.<\/p>\n<p>I was in pain, bleeding, and I didn&#8217;t want to get into trouble. \u00a0 I immediately rushed upstairs to my room. \u00a0 Likely I had a cry session up there. \u00a0 I also monitored the bleeding to make sure it wasn&#8217;t to the point that I would have to get Gee involved. \u00a0 From my memory the only blood that occurred was from that initial it. \u00a0Likely it caused a scrape and no major damage (or we can blame that bear for everything in life that has happened since). \u00a0 I don&#8217;t remember much more blood but the bump was there. \u00a0 Luckily for my young self I had a think head of hair like in the picture above.<\/p>\n<p>I checked in the bathroom and there was no visual signs I was hurt. \u00a0 \u00a0There was no obvious blood. \u00a0 The bump was sufficiently hidden under my mane. \u00a0 I could get away with this. \u00a0 I then wandered downstairs to have dinner. \u00a0 Nothing was said. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t admit anything. \u00a0 I wasn&#8217;t questioned about anything. \u00a0I did get away with this. \u00a0My grandmother in theory could still scold me, but I think after thirty some years I would just get away with it at this point.<\/p>\n<p>This whole incident changed my relationship with that bear. \u00a0 It no longer was a companion. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t something I would haul around. \u00a0 It was a relic of my days as a baby. \u00a0This is a specific moment that I can that I grew up a little and left a little bit of my childhood behind. \u00a0 The idea of that hurts a little. \u00a0 I was still young enough when it happened that I blamed the bear with the big hunk of metal in it. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t the bear&#8217;s fault though (obviously). \u00a0I hope that one day the bear pops up again. \u00a0 Lost in a box buried at the top of the garage. \u00a0Just waiting for the day he can be shown off. \u00a0 However, I do have a seven year old &#8211; and the bear has already had it&#8217;s taste of human blood. \u00a0 You can never really trust a teddy bear again that has wetted it&#8217;s snout\u00a0with human blood. \u00a0Five or six year old me will attest to that one.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have so many artifacts in my house from my childhood. \u00a0 I almost feel like the old man in Tusk when he starts in on the &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a long and storied life&#8221;. \u00a0 &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95088,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95087"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95087"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95087\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95088"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95087"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95087"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95087"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
