We scan them every once in a great while when we think something is amiss &#8211; but 9 times out of 10 it&#8217;s usually spyware. (Disclaimer &#8211; my work machine runs Norton Anti-Virus corporate edition which I recommend if you are going to buy an AV solution)<\/p>\n<p>The reasons that we never really ran it are a few, but mostly that we follow good internet practices.<\/p>\n<p>1. We do not randomly\u00a0open file attachments &#8211; usually we know when someone we trust is sending us something and it wouldn&#8217;t have the title &#8220;check this out&#8221; our contacts will usually put something more personal in the text that wasn&#8217;t as generic as 99% of email viruses.<\/p>\n<p>2. We download from trusted sources<\/p>\n<p>3. Our computers ever never been directly exposed to the internet so no incoming worms here.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s always better to be safe than sorry. Recently because she thought she had a mystery virus my wife has fought with Clam AV to find it on her PC. Nothing shows up but it takes a lot of CPU and seems to take 12-13 hours to scan her machine. Because of the CPU hit her machine is mostly useless to her for this time frame.<\/p>\n<p>How can we correct that?<\/p>\n<p>We are going to design a centralized AV scanning box<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now from a corporate network perspective not all of my ideas are sound and productive goals to go about things &#8211; but from a small home network we can get away with a bit more. &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94460,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/105"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=105"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/105\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94460"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=105"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=105"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=105"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
