Even non-internet shoppers are quite aware that you almost never pay the MSRP (manufacturer&#8217;s suggested retail price) for anything. It&#8217;s not even their fault 99% of everything in life is priced below MSRP. Let&#8217;s look at the big things first, with the exception of the buy one get one free deals that seem to be in vogue with Kia there is almost no one on the planet that expects to pay the sticker price on a new car. There are times that in <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/business\/2375967.stm\">retail companies have been caught trying to control the price of their wares<\/a>, but in normal scenarios it doesn&#8217;t work out.<\/p>\n<p>My problem however is when they say for example a 2 GB flash memory card has an MSRP of $20.00. Now almost everywhere in the planet you can get this same card for $9.99. Most stores will advertise that the price is fifty percent off the MSRP and it&#8217;s a huge discount off. Unfortunately they are merely price matching. In some scenarios the vendors themselves try this tactic. Now if a vendor is selling something (full time mind you not a once in awhile sale) for $9.99, how can they say their MSRP is $20.00. Sorry just another advertisement about MSRP and comparing the &#8220;low price&#8221; you can get it for (standard price) bragging about the sale set me off.<\/p>\n<p>Sorry for the rant.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from here Why are MSRP&#8217;s so far off of the real price of an item?
