fair enough.\u00a0\u00a0 The second was the part that disgusted me, she didn&#8217;t feel she had to work.\u00a0 She complained that this was her time to enjoy with grandchildren and she shouldn&#8217;t have to work.\u00a0\u00a0 She told me how she was going to pay all the bills with her inheritance and be happy.\u00a0 That was the life she always envisioned and she was upset she wasn&#8217;t going to get it.\u00a0 She sounded like the preppy girl complaining that she came in second place in a beauty pagent, and if she cried and screamed loud enough someone else would fix it.<\/p>\n<p>She got back together with him, not for love, but live a more comfortable life.\u00a0\u00a0 Why I won&#8217;t explicitly say that, someone who lies in bed with someone else for money as the primary reason&#8230;&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>I knew this, my siblings knew this, my wife knew this.\u00a0\u00a0 He held no power over me and I wasn&#8217;t going to have any of it.\u00a0\u00a0 He had put my mother through months of pain, helping my mother out because of this was part of the reason I moved back to Ohio from Oregon.\u00a0\u00a0 I had been a part of that house and family for many years.\u00a0\u00a0 At this point he asked me to leave.\u00a0\u00a0 As I&#8217;m walking out I&#8217;m still arguing on my way to the car.\u00a0\u00a0 My mother told me the words that are opposite of what I&#8217;ve been told that a mother is supposed to say &#8211; she told me that it wasn&#8217;t my home anymore.<\/p>\n<p>I had grown up my whole life with my mother telling me that it would always be my home.\u00a0\u00a0 She however would choose to be with her part time husband and choose his side over mine.\u00a0\u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t the first time she did that though.\u00a0 My step father told me to never come back and I wasn&#8217;t welcome there anymore.\u00a0\u00a0 So be it.\u00a0\u00a0 My mother has relinquished what she wants or believes in for her comfort.\u00a0\u00a0 She tries now to deny what she said (like she always denies what she says) but my wife heard it also and her jar dropped.\u00a0\u00a0 My wife had seen the drag out fights amongst my family, and this wasn&#8217;t the worst.\u00a0 This was my mother clinging to safety and the fear of being alone.\u00a0 If I thought she did it because she wanted to, because love made her do strange things, then I would forgive.\u00a0 My mother is more calculating in protecting herself though.\u00a0 She will protect herself over the expense of others.<\/p>\n<p>For the record if my step father ever shows up on my door step, the first thing I&#8217;m doing is calling the police.<\/p>\n<p>This is the incident that is the proverbial straw.\u00a0 Does it sound stupid?\u00a0 I&#8217;m sure it does.\u00a0\u00a0 I won&#8217;t deny it.\u00a0\u00a0 Starting tomorrow we&#8217;ll be working on how we got to here.<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rather building up to the explosive end, I figured it better to start at the end and show how it built up to that.\u00a0\u00a0 Hopefully this will allow me to end this journey with something &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3519"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3519"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3519\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3519"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3519"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3519"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
