of course, they were all ATK since AFKing didn&#8217;t exist yet.\u00a0 The pseudo-leader of the cantina at the time was Kathryn, who more or less had business ideas galore.\u00a0 She had us running advertisements around the shuttle port for a tailor named Bifein.\u00a0 There were many of us there in Tyrena, and while I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll leave some important people I&#8217;ll give out some of the names.\u00a0 The entertainer crowd was formed by Agaar, Neena-Marie, Silentbob, Xie &#8216;lanthia, Candyce, Punasti, Moya&#8217;, Alich, Kathryn, and Lanfear.\u00a0 Most notable customers were Astrolite (Sliced the first Light Saber in SWG), Blood (founder of EIS), Shinjo (Intrepid&#8217;s Original Bad Boy), Nemo (Intrepid&#8217;s First Master Architect), and Davinci (arguably the best Weapon smith and quest master that Intrepid ever saw).<\/p>\n<p>The group of Tyrena Entertainers formed Star Dragon Entertainment, I was the spokesman and comedian of the group, and Xie more or less controlled the dancers and organization of the groups. She also named the band. Star Dragon entertainment folded into SCO which became SGO. Some members like NeenaMarie stayed with them until the NGE hit. SCO was Intrepid&#8217;s first guild ever built by Nemo.\u00a0\u00a0 I was asked to be head of the entertainers but I declined I wanted a guild of my own.<\/p>\n<p>Back when we had to pay for training all the entertainers would pool money together to get a new skill since the person getting the skill could then train others for free.\u00a0\u00a0 We were very communal and worked together to get things done.\u00a0 Xie and I mastered Entertainer and decided to go out in the big huge world.\u00a0\u00a0 We visited Mos Eisley, the busiest and most bustling area of activity in the galaxy; there were 4-5 full groups of 20 players playing in groups at the same time in the Eisley Cantina.\u00a0 It was insane and fun but definitely too busy for me.\u00a0\u00a0 We journeyed to Naboo, where the people there acted like they had a pikeman&#8217;s lance shoved up to you know where, but almost as busy as Eisley.\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, we wandered to Coronet where we met the second group of people that we would forever refer to as friends, Imcus Vree, En-chi Lada, and Chon Wang.\u00a0 We performed together and called ourselves the Def Stars.<\/p>\n<p>Around this time period a tailor outside of Coronet had just mastered a certain box of field wear that allowed him to craft gunmen&#8217;s dusters.\u00a0\u00a0 The place was insane with shoppers and Mokilok was the king of tailoring on Intrepid for a time because of it.\u00a0\u00a0 I still own the Mokilok Duster I purchased that day.\u00a0\u00a0 When I managed to visit once to get a custom order he had built himself a throne surrounded by torches and to say the least he was a unique individual.\u00a0\u00a0 A weapon smith outside of the Coronet was close to mastering and was known for making the best guns at the time.\u00a0 His name was Idunno Udunno.\u00a0\u00a0 While I know I won&#8217;t remember all of them, Idunno, Zarina, and Mokilok were pivotal in creating the group that was known galaxy-wide as the Corellian Mafia.<\/p>\n<p>During this time I made money traveling from Cantina to Cantina across the galaxy selling instruments.\u00a0 I made a healthy profit off of it.\u00a0\u00a0 Though one time I got stuck on Rori for a few hours until Davinci could wire me enough credits so I could fly back to Naboo. I was known for crafting instruments and was one of the main sellers in the Galaxy.\u00a0 So much so that Moya&#8217; made everyone promise not to mention that he was selling instruments and cutting into my sales.\u00a0\u00a0 I do know that Neill who still posts on the Entertainer forums made a special request for me to fly all the way to some out-of-the-way Cantina to deliver him a specially crafted instrument.\u00a0 Thankfully just as prices were starting to kick up I managed to start buying weapon power-ups off the bazaar in Coronet and taking them to Tyrena Bazaar and sealing them for a profit.\u00a0\u00a0 I made a pretty penny (for this time period) and then one day I was tipped 276521 credits &#8211; still an important figure for me.\u00a0\u00a0 All my friends at the time thought I was rich, and I thought for the longest time that it was credits gotten through an exploit (that should tell some of you how bad inflation is today).<\/p>\n<p>One day Xie and I being master entertainers were invited to a &#8220;Masters Ball&#8221; since there were so few masters of any profession at that time it was an honor and a select few.\u00a0 We wanted to take friends to share in the event as we were allowed to bring any guest we may like.\u00a0\u00a0 Xie took along Moya&#8217; and I took along Alich.\u00a0\u00a0 They were both still working in the entertainer profession and thought it would be nice to have them mingle with us.\u00a0\u00a0 Little did I know that the two Wookiees thought that these were traditional dates.\u00a0\u00a0 This became apparent when Xie lost her life and Moya&#8217; mourned the loss, I had to explain to Alich that my lekkus don&#8217;t swing that way.\u00a0 Though I still heard about it from Moya&#8217; for years.\u00a0 I just mention that Moya&#8217; managed to watch his date murdered and didn&#8217;t do anything to stop it.<\/p>\n<p>Moya&#8217; did manage to get me back.\u00a0 Talking in the Tyrena cantina with En-chi Lada, Moya&#8217;, Candyce, and\u00a0 Xie I believe; I was complaining that the cantina didn&#8217;t have any restrooms, and as far as I could decipher I couldn&#8217;t find any public restrooms at all.<\/p>\n<p>Moya&#8217; then told En-Chi and me that he had seen a restroom over in the Tyrena hotel. The Tyrena Hotel? Why that was just across the street. I had been holding my bodily functions for so long and salvation was so close? Why had the Galactic gods tormented me so by having a restroom so close by?<\/p>\n<p>En-chi and I rushed over to the hotel in hope of relieving ourselves.\u00a0 We searched that hotel from top to bottom (ok it&#8217;s only one floor but there was another argument with Moya&#8217; over elevators). We started screaming at Moya&#8217;. Moya&#8217; came over and started trying to find this infamous restroom. It seems the Wookiee thought a decorative alcove was a restroom &#8211; it seems that you should never tell a Wookiee how to get to the indoor restroom &#8211; always walk them there.\u00a0 On a side note because of this incident, I finally built a restroom in my house and that toilet got a lot of use.<\/p>\n<p>I parlayed my money into more buying and reselling and eventually got the credits over 1 million after a couple of weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 Around this time period Davinci sent me a tell while I was performing in the Tyrena Cantina, he told me &#8220;Ding, I did it&#8221;- after clarifying he had made the highest damage laser rifles in the galaxy.\u00a0\u00a0 He named them the widow maker &#8211; there was another customer so Davinci held a number guessing contest to choose the buyers.\u00a0 Since I was buying two I got two guesses.\u00a0 All said and done I managed to get both the highest DPS rifle on the server (I still own it) and the lowest mind cost rifle on the server (Xie still owns hers).<\/p>\n<p>Going back to the funny incidents there was a player named Clark Griswold on the Intrepid who managed to lose the waypoint to his house.\u00a0\u00a0 A server-wide search north of Theed went on to look for his house.\u00a0\u00a0 Out of a joke En-Chi and I managed to buy an identically styled house and place it down.\u00a0 Naming it Clark&#8217;s house.\u00a0\u00a0 The next day cheers were going on that someone had found Clark&#8217;s house.\u00a0\u00a0 En-chi and I were rolling over this.\u00a0 Clark went to the waypoint and tried to get in but didn&#8217;t manage to get through the door.\u00a0\u00a0 He then figured out the ruse and realized it wasn&#8217;t his house.\u00a0\u00a0 A big outrage started from certain people on the forum and En-Chi and I owned up to it instead of slinking away.\u00a0 Afterward it was quite a joke and everyone laughed.<\/p>\n<p>I worked on starting the first museums on the Intrepid server, trying to catalog and save every little thing I could find.\u00a0\u00a0 Padre helped me in my hunt on collecting anything and everything rare.\u00a0 I never sold a donation and every donation I received when I closed the museums later were donated to other people, or I still have them.\u00a0\u00a0 It was never for me, I never made a dime off it.\u00a0 I did it for the server community and that&#8217;s where I spent most of my money.\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, two days before my public opening someone else opened a museum.\u00a0 I can say I started the first museum on Intrepid, but mine was the second opened to the public.\u00a0\u00a0 Mine was made of 4 medium Naboo buildings filled to the brim.\u00a0 I was quite proud of that.<\/p>\n<p>A new person came onto the scene at this time.\u00a0 His name was Keltrien.\u00a0\u00a0 He had big ideas and bigger ambitions.\u00a0\u00a0 After working through some starter thoughts on the message boards for a few weeks he decided he was going to run a server-wide festival.\u00a0 He pulled it off with Xie and I gathering entertainers to perform and his working the money makers on the server for donations.\u00a0\u00a0 Groovefest was born and Keltrien said it was good.<\/p>\n<p>Keltrien went on to run many more Groovefest and whether it was from direct help or indirect (renting vendor space) I helped him whenever I could.\u00a0 I can say the other festivals the server has seen since have never been as big as the ones Keltrien threw.\u00a0\u00a0 This was an atmosphere with hundreds of people milling about, shopping, and having a good time.\u00a0\u00a0 Keltrien managed to start a city on Tatooine just to hold Groovefest events.\u00a0\u00a0 Keltrien went on to start a regular weekly speeder bike competition and a droid fighting competition.\u00a0 Keltrien did a lot for Intrepid&#8217;s community and he shouldn&#8217;t be forgotten for that.<\/p>\n<p>Keltrien however didn\u2019t own a monopoly on large-scale events.\u00a0 Another event started was a music performance competition and it was arranged by Jerik.\u00a0 Jerik started the IJB (Intrepid Jam Bonanza) competition.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the Def Stars had stopped being entertainers, but Xie and I thought we would enter one last competition as the Def Stars.\u00a0 There were only two of us and we needed a third.\u00a0 We recruited Moya&#8217;.\u00a0 We rehearsed and polished our macros for the competition.\u00a0 On the day of the competition, we managed to get our guild hall.\u00a0 We showed up at the competition with the DEF guild tag above our heads.\u00a0\u00a0 Ironically you would have thought this was a normal music competition, by today\u2019s standards it was but then it was something different.\u00a0\u00a0 They wanted to know who wanted to go when we fought for and won the right to go last place.\u00a0 The entire competition went on and then we were on.\u00a0 Everyone thought that it was going to be the same song arrangement.\u00a0 For the entertainers in the group that can audilize it, we played Starwars1 &#8211; with 2 mandoviol&#8217;s and an omnibox.\u00a0 So we had a true rock and roll sound.\u00a0 Not only that we sang lyrics.\u00a0 Singing lyrics was unheard of in the cantina or in competition.\u00a0 None of the other competitors sang, some think we demeaned the competition.\u00a0 But to every other non-entrant there it blew them away and we won.\u00a0\u00a0 Ironically for all those on Intrepid that have to endure all the entertainers singing in the cantina now, you\u2019re welcome.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the lyrics as performed at the IJB by the Def Stars<\/p>\n<p><em><u>The AFK Entertainer<\/u><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m the afk entertainer<\/em><br \/>\n<em>And I know just where to stand<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Another AFKer<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Another macro band<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Today I am your healer<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I may have won your creds<\/em><br \/>\n<em>But I know the game<\/em><br \/>\n<em>You&#8217;ll forget my name<\/em><br \/>\n<em>And I won&#8217;t be here for a jawa beer<\/em><br \/>\n<em>If I don&#8217;t stay on the star charts<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Chorus:<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Oh yeah, macro baby macro<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Oh yeah, macro baby macro<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m the afk entertainer<\/em><br \/>\n<em>And I&#8217;ve had to pay my price<\/em><br \/>\n<em>The things I did not know at first<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I got free training, NICE!<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Ah but still it comes to haunt me<\/em><br \/>\n<em>My tailor I need to pay<\/em><br \/>\n<em>So I&#8217;ve learned to dance<\/em><br \/>\n<em>With a macro and hot pants<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I rub their neck and give my macro a check<\/em><br \/>\n<em>As they tip because their BF goes way<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Chorus:<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Oh yeah, macro baby macro<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Oh yeah, macro baby macro<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m the afk entertainer<\/em><br \/>\n<em>Been all around the worlds<\/em><br \/>\n<em>I&#8217;ve said &#8220;tip me&#8221;

that would be between 150-200 million.\u00a0 That&#8217;s how much purchasing power that bought.\u00a0 I wanted to use the money to start a city &#8211; &#8220;New Tyrena&#8221;.\u00a0 We purchased our city hall and were ready to go, I was going to be mayor and Imcus was going to be the city planner.\u00a0 Well, the city planner profession was scrapped, but Imcus was still the designer.\u00a0 We spent weeks looking for a spot and finally found one.\u00a0\u00a0 We were ready, the City patch came, and we were too slow.\u00a0\u00a0 The planet was already capped.\u00a0\u00a0 A week or two later SOE decided to raise the planetary caps and we managed to get our city down.\u00a0\u00a0 Symphonia was born and it still stands there today.<\/p>\n<p>We spent a couple of nights packing up and moving all the museums from their current location to Symphonia, these buildings became the back wall of Symphonia&#8217;s main quad.\u00a0\u00a0 We grew and flourished and focused on DEF being an entertainer-only guild and Symphonia a city dedicated to the arts.\u00a0\u00a0 Then because of personal reasons, I had to quit the game suddenly without telling anyone except I sent a message to Moya&#8217;.\u00a0 I gave Moya&#8217; access to my accounts to move things around but I wasn&#8217;t logging in.\u00a0\u00a0 They held a funeral for the character Creeva in Symphonia, and it was SWG&#8217;s first as far as anyone could tell (this was Jan 2004).\u00a0 Looking at screenshots I&#8217;ve seen of that day it seems at least 50 people showed up.\u00a0 This was to a funeral in a video game.\u00a0\u00a0 Imcus and Moya&#8217; wrote a song called Sgt. Creeva&#8217;s Band.\u00a0\u00a0 I was touched even being outside the game.\u00a0\u00a0 The museums were saved and life would go on.<\/p>\n<p>After a month or two I managed to get things straightened out so I could log back in.\u00a0\u00a0 At this time I was welcomed with joy.\u00a0 Imcus had taken over as mayor and still is to this day.\u00a0\u00a0 The museums grew and life went on.\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I&#8217;m sure there are some significant issues that happened around this time, more Groovefest and such.\u00a0 A dark peril started circling the galaxy the AFK entertainer and the hologrind.\u00a0\u00a0 The AFKing had been growing for months but grew to a peak when Monika unlocked the first Jedi Akinom on the Intrepid server.\u00a0\u00a0 I was there in Coronet the first night the first Jedi was wandering SWG.\u00a0 It was awe-inspiring.\u00a0 My RL friend Astrolite managed to slice her lightsaber, getting the no-trade item across via the droid storage compartment &#8211; now that&#8217;s a true smuggler.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The appearance of the Jedi showed that unlocking professions were the path &#8211; this lead to the hologrind.<\/p>\n<p>The hologrind was a way of life the cantina was piled full of AFKers just trying to master the profession so they could move on to the next one.\u00a0 What made matters worse in SOE&#8217;s attempt to encourage this they gave everyone Holocrons for x-mas.\u00a0 Some people received two since there was a bug where some players never received the first one.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This further increased the use of holocrons to discover what profession you needed next to finish your path onto Jedi.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I can say that I never opened my holocron and it is still on display at the Entertainer Museum in Symphonia.\u00a0\u00a0 The golden age of SWG was over and a new dawn was coming.\u00a0\u00a0 I was a strong anti-AFK advocate but in the minority, the ATK entertainers were overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<p>There were good times and bad times during this stage, DEF added more members over time.\u00a0 Amber and Siri are the most notable.\u00a0 Outside of Moya&#8217; and Imcus, Amber has been the longest member of DEF.\u00a0 Siri was the largest cross-server superstar (outside ourselves of course :P) to join the guild.\u00a0\u00a0 The guild however wasn&#8217;t growing and disagreements on who to bring and who not to lead slowly to a partial dissolution.\u00a0\u00a0 Xie had wanted more of a consensus instead of taking weeks to guild a member and she wanted to step down from being the decision maker of the guild, she was mostly the decision maker since she was the tie maker or breaker and was kind of the unofficial leader because of it.\u00a0\u00a0 Moya&#8217; and I were doing the museum thing, especially with starting the Wookiee Cultural Center in Symphonia.\u00a0 Imcus was busy chasing his Jedi dream (no holocrons were used as far as I know) so Xie was kind of left holding the back. Things had come to a point and the SWG combat upgrade hit us smack in the face.<\/p>\n<p>Xie and I forced the issue with the guild on two fronts.\u00a0 Because of the combat upgrade, I was going to leave the guild for a while, I was respeccing out of entertainer and I didn&#8217;t think I should be in a guild called the Dedicated Entertainment Foundation without being an entertainer.\u00a0\u00a0 Xie wanted more cantina time for the guild and thought that while DEF should remain if they weren&#8217;t going to be in the cantina and actively working as entertainers we should take entertainment out of the guild name.\u00a0\u00a0 Ironically Siri left Intrepid forever to get away from the fame and because DEF never really supported her in the guild.\u00a0\u00a0 Things were quickly creeping up.<\/p>\n<p>SOE finally decided to give entertainers a little bit of love and brought out a new song and dance via a theater quest and at this time Jerik decided it was time to do another IJB.\u00a0\u00a0 There had been IJBs since the first but DEF resisted entering them this one was rumored to be the last one.\u00a0 DEF had members enter in the other bands to perform in the IJB but we didn&#8217;t compete as a group.\u00a0\u00a0 For the last IJB, we came together again (except Xie who sat it out), since Xie wasn&#8217;t there we weren&#8217;t going to use the Def Star name.\u00a0 So we came up with the Def Spurs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Def Spurs came in second, there was some controversy over this since the winning band had gotten a do-over because they screwed up.\u00a0\u00a0 I still think that comes with the territory.\u00a0 I still performed a lot at this time and with the big credit duping scandal there were massive in-game protests.\u00a0 Xie relayed the news to me at work and a fledging Intrepid organization came into being.\u00a0 The INN &#8211; the Intrepid News Network. \u00a0 Ironically their news coverage made it to the major gaming blogs and they were an Intrepid staple for some time to come.<\/p>\n<p>Whichever Groovefest it was at this time &#8211; I did my own protest song.\u00a0 Which caught on quite a bit:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:

building up and Xie and I took the guild aside and explained our concerns about what had been happening and our thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0 Because of a continual lack of consensus and everyone wanting not to hurt anyone else&#8217;s feelings, Xie and I left the guild.\u00a0 Her for lack of entertainer focus and not changing the guild name to reflect it, myself for leaving entertainer.\u00a0\u00a0 From my understanding, the members left behind in DEF feel we betrayed them and had a united front against them in our leaving.\u00a0\u00a0 Xie and I each had our own reasons just the timing that happened the same day.<\/p>\n<p>I stayed a member of Symphonia and maintained my museums and my vendors.\u00a0\u00a0 My vendors were pulling in millions a week, that&#8217;s saying a lot for a player who only bought low and sold low.\u00a0 I would say I only crafted less than 1% of everything I&#8217;ve sold.\u00a0\u00a0 For this sake of argument, I will also include gathering resources as crafting since I never had lots for harvesters.\u00a0\u00a0 I kept all my resources regardless of quality at identical pricing and maintained some of the best prices on the server with the largest variety.\u00a0 For my rarities, I would buy out other vendors and then make my prices the cheapest in the galaxy.\u00a0 I made huge profits on quantity instead of price gouging.<\/p>\n<p>The combat upgrade was in full effect and the silver age of Star Wars galaxies had come to a halt.<\/p>\n<p>I could discuss the village and other grinds and stories that go along with this time, but I still have more to tell and this tale is already quite lengthy.\u00a0 We fast forward to the NGE, ironically because I was moving across the country and internet service would be spotty I quit SWG for a while.\u00a0 Xie had quit a few months before me.<\/p>\n<p>After settling into a new house that I bought I decided it was time to check out SWG again.\u00a0 I conned Xie into coming back with me.\u00a0\u00a0 We both wanted to be in an Entertainer guild again but knew DEF has not focused on that anymore.\u00a0 So we started STARS.<\/p>\n<p>We did fall into the same stagnation as we did with DEF though and it fell apart.\u00a0 It just proves that no matter how passionate or dedicated you are that no true entertainer guild that promotes ATK survives on Intrepid.\u00a0\u00a0 We also managed to start a new city called Pirates Retreat on Rori, it started falling apart after the housing cleanup.\u00a0 That&#8217;s fine, I never really wanted a shuttle, but many residents did.\u00a0\u00a0 So all in all I founded two cities dedicated to entertainment and two guilds dedicated to the same.<\/p>\n<p>For my, in-game tales I&#8217;ll leave it at that.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve been an active member since the launch of the Intrepid and Entertainer forums.\u00a0 I was in the running for being the first musician correspondent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I wrote many tipping, etiquette, and performance guides for entertainers on the forums.\u00a0\u00a0 I did what I could to promote ATK entertainers all the time.\u00a0\u00a0 I started the infamous IPS on the Intrepid forums and it lives on today in its fifth generation.\u00a0 I will miss it.\u00a0\u00a0 I will keep posting until I can&#8217;t anymore, but my account runs out on March 1st. 2008.\u00a0 And with that, I&#8217;ll be gone from in-game so I&#8217;m posting this now while I still can.<\/p>\n<p>Some of you are going to deride this tale that I&#8217;ve relayed.\u00a0 That&#8217;s fine, you are not the ones I\u2019m trying to reach.\u00a0 SWG has been a place for friends and communities.\u00a0 Friendships crafted here transcend the game and forge real-life bonds.\u00a0 I may not be an entertaining superstar in real life, but I am now playing in two real-life community bands.\u00a0\u00a0 The friendships I have there are not as strong as the ones I&#8217;ve made here.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;ve spent 1\/6 of my life on Intrepid.\u00a0\u00a0 It has been a good journey.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve made friends I email daily. I&#8217;m working on a real-life business venture with Keltrien.\u00a0 I have had dinner on the coast with Moya&#8217;.\u00a0 These are real things and real people.<\/p>\n<p>Some people think this is just a game.\u00a0 It never was met to be.\u00a0\u00a0 It was a community.\u00a0 A community you can&#8217;t find anywhere else, I&#8217;ve looked.\u00a0\u00a0 You can&#8217;t get both sides together and socialize and have fun.\u00a0 Either the social side is terrible or they keep factions apart.\u00a0\u00a0 For those of you that understand what I&#8217;m saying and have that, hang on to it.\u00a0\u00a0 Literally, 99% of the people I counted closest to me are gone.\u00a0 It is my time to join them.\u00a0 SOE not policing any AFKing for any profession was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back.<\/p>\n<p>No, you can&#8217;t have my stuff.\u00a0 I will be logging in tonight though.\u00a0\u00a0 I do make one last promise to Intrepid and then I will be silent on what I can offer.\u00a0 I promise as long as there is at least a few day&#8217;s notice, I will be back in the final month of the game.\u00a0\u00a0 On the final day I will be performing in the Tyrena cantina, I will perform there that day until the servers go black and never again alight.<\/p>\n<p>To end on a corny note, May the force be with you, always.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SWG, what a long strange journey it&#8217;s been.
