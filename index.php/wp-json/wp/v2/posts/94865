I can say something that few people under forty can say &#8211; I saw all the Star Wars movies in the theater. \u00a0 I have even seen them all more than once.<\/p>\n<p>As a child my grandparents bought me Star Wars toys. \u00a0 Around age 4 I got the TIE\u00a0Fighter that had wings that popped off. \u00a0Unfortunately the wings eventually separated from the plastic supports that made them pop off. \u00a0My father spent way too many fixing and gluing the wings, but eventually I just had a TIE\u00a0Fighter without any wings. \u00a0It didn&#8217;t matter; this was still an important toy of my childhood. \u00a0 From taking the figures into the sandbox or keeping me company on road trips &#8211; Luke, Han, R2-D2, and the rest kept me company. \u00a0My\u00a0grandmother was going to get me the complete collection of figures. \u00a0 Unfortunately she passed away when I was six. \u00a0 For some reason the rest of my family was never as invested into satiating my Star Wars desires.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94873\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/star-wars-1-1024x523.jpg\" alt=\"star-wars\" width=\"640\" height=\"327\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/star-wars-1-1024x523.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/star-wars-1-300x153.jpg 300w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/star-wars-1-768x392.jpg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/star-wars-1-1536x784.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/star-wars-1-1070x546.jpg 1070w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/star-wars-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By the time I entered into Open Door for elementary school everyone was obsessed with Star Wars. \u00a0 It was a regular thing to play Star Wars on the playground. \u00a0 There was the four-way jungle gym that was the Millennium Falcon when we played. \u00a0 The monkey bars were normally designated to be an X-wing for whoever was Luke that day. \u00a0 I dressed up in cheap Star Wars Halloween costumes in my younger years, but eventually these became hard to harder to find. \u00a0 I always wanted one of the good Star Wars masks. \u00a0 Spencer&#8217;s at Midway Mall carried an assortment over the years &#8211; including the helmets for Vader, Stormtroopers, Boba Fett \u00a0&#8211; and curiously a Tusken Raider. \u00a0 My parents wouldn&#8217;t buy me the expensive masks. \u00a0It wouldn&#8217;t be until the prequels were released that I would get a decent Vader helmet. \u00a0 I also own two high quality Stormtrooper helmets and toy quality helmets for Boba Fett and Clone Troopers. \u00a0Every time I put them on, I&#8217;m transported back to that playground in Elyria.<\/p>\n<p>Around my seventh birthday I had money that I was going buy myself a birthday present. \u00a0 I knew what I wanted, it just depended on if the store had it. \u00a0 My parents drove me to Gold Circle and let me loose with my babysitter. \u00a0 Why my babysitter was there, I had no idea. \u00a0Maybe she wanted to buy a new record. \u00a0 Regardless she went to take me to the toy section to pick out something to buy. \u00a0I wanted a light saber. \u00a0 This wasn&#8217;t one of the nifty light sabers that retract like kid&#8217;s have today. \u00a0This was a tube on top of handle that stayed open full time. \u00a0 \u00a0It was the best that it could be at the time.<\/p>\n<p>This light saber was my prize. \u00a0It made swooshing sounds as you swung it. \u00a0 It would have allowed me to finally be the Jedi I always wanted to be. \u00a0 My babysitter had other thoughts. \u00a0 She told me that it would break in a couple days and I should get something else. \u00a0 Now I was seven, so I was cowed by the authority figure my babysitter represented. \u00a0 I tried to argue and justify, but it all just died down. \u00a0 She talked me out of it and I bought something else. \u00a0 I bought something that would last longer and I would get more playtime with. \u00a0The thing is, I don&#8217;t remember what that was. \u00a0I&#8217;m sure I just bought whatever she thought was best for me. \u00a0I chose it to shut her up and so I wouldn&#8217;t feel bad about getting lectured. \u00a0 The thing is, whatever it was, it is forgotten. \u00a0I still remember the pain of not getting that light saber over thirty-two years later. \u00a0That sucks.<\/p>\n<p>Sometime after this the Star Wars craze ended for most people. \u00a0 The toys dried up at the store. \u00a0 People stopped discussing it. \u00a0 If you were still a fan, it was no longer being a part of a moment in pop culture &#8211; you were a geek. \u00a0If I was lucky I could catch the movies when they were aired on TV as part of a yearly event in the same way that the Wizard of Oz was shown. \u00a0 The thing is half the time my parents wouldn&#8217;t allow me to stay up and watch the whole thing. \u00a0 I would get to see the movie just up to the Cantina scene for many years. \u00a0 It is annoying now that I look back that my parents wouldn&#8217;t allow me to stay up. \u00a0Anytime the special movie was the Wizard of Oz of The Sound of Music they happily allowed me to stay up to eleven or twelve to watch the whole thing. \u00a0 Their idea of an event is much different than that of an adolescent that rarely got the chance to watch his favorite movie.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually it came out on VHS tape, so occasionally I managed to rent one of the movies. \u00a0 These kept them fresh in my mind. \u00a0 When the Amherst Library carried them I would get them every few months when I stayed over at my grandmother&#8217;s. \u00a0 One day in the Vermilion Library I saw the strangest thing. \u00a0 It was a Star Wars book. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t the Han Solo Adventures that I had read or the novelizations of the movies &#8211; it was something new. \u00a0It was the Timothy Zahn trilogy. \u00a0Outside of the Marvel Comics, this was the first step into an extended universe of Star Wars. \u00a0I devoured them. \u00a0 I think by now I&#8217;ve read them at least three times. \u00a0I finally knew what happened after the movies and my strong passion was reunited. \u00a0Unfortunately we still lived in a world where a Star Wars fan was a geek. \u00a0 I had no one to share it with.<\/p>\n<p>My senior year of high school I took drivers education. \u00a0 In that class was a guy named Muska. \u00a0 One night it felt this weird guy from class was following me home so we started talking. \u00a0 His cousin&#8217;s house was a couple of houses down from my own. \u00a0 He went there until his parents could pick him up. \u00a0As we did these regular walks we became best friends. \u00a0 We bonded over Star Wars. \u00a0 He introduced me to the X-Wing video game since my family just got a computer. \u00a0 We worked through the Super Star Wars Trilogy on the SNES. \u00a0 He exposed me to the continuing Star Wars universe in the books that picked up after the Zahn novels. \u00a0 We hunted through Jamie&#8217;s Flea Market for cheap old figures. \u00a0It was a match made in geekdom.<\/p>\n<p>The first time I got to see any movies from the original trilogy in the theater was in 1994. \u00a0 There was a theater on the other side of Cleveland that was showing all three movies each night for three nights. \u00a0 Muska, my girlfriend Kim, and I packed into the car and made the hour drive to see the shows. \u00a0When we got there on Friday night A New Hope was sold out. \u00a0We opted to watch The Empire Strikes Back instead. \u00a0 It was as fantastic as you can imagine. \u00a0 The next day was my graduation party. \u00a0 I told everyone to arrive early because I was going to be leaving in the evening to go back to the theater a second time. \u00a0 I had a shortened graduation party &#8211; because of Star Wars.<\/p>\n<p>Logically you would think we would have seen Return of the Jedi. \u00a0Unfortunately Kim stated that she wouldn&#8217;t comeback a third night. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t know if there was some place we had to be or why Muska and I just didn&#8217;t plan on coming back by ourselves that night &#8211; but this was are last trip to this theater. \u00a0 Knowing this we opted to watch A New Hope. \u00a0 Seeing it on the screen was everything I could hope for. However, I regretted that I could not see all three.<\/p>\n<p>A few months after that I shipped off to my singular year of college. \u00a0 Over the year I went through four and half roommates. \u00a0The half room mate was a guy who slept on the couch &#8211; yet didn&#8217;t attend the school. \u00a0It was a college clich\u00e9 that I lived through. \u00a0 My last two room mates though; they both had a love of Star Wars that was parallel to my own. \u00a0 Late night Star Wars discussions and playing X-Wing on the computer lead to a great bond that I will always remember them by. \u00a0 Towards the end of the school year I bought an iguana. \u00a0 It was already quite large and I named her Mara Jade after a character in the Zahn novels.<\/p>\n<p>After school I knew I wouldn&#8217;t return. \u00a0 I lived at my mother&#8217;s house for about a week before I was back together and living with Kim. \u00a0 Unfortunately she didn&#8217;t want an iguana in the apartment. \u00a0 It was the light saber issue all over again. \u00a0I loved my iguana, yet wanted the approval of a female. \u00a0 It did have more weight that I was living with this one. \u00a0 Because of that I ended up giving Mara to one of my college roommates who took her back to school. \u00a0 It was sad and she was a good a lizard.<\/p>\n<p>Living with Kim was difficult in many ways. \u00a0 I think the largest is that while she enjoyed geek things &#8211; she didn&#8217;t want to be seen as a geek. \u00a0She refused to wallow in the geek mud like I am happy to do. \u00a0 She had an original Empire Strikes Back Millennium Falcon in the box (opened and in played with condition) &#8211; yet it always sat away in the closet. \u00a0 She didn&#8217;t understand my obsession. \u00a0They were just movies to her. \u00a0 I would sit and read through Star Wars books and magazines &#8211; she would read trashy romance novels. \u00a0 She went from dead end job to dead end job &#8211; I followed the start of what would become a lifelong career in IT. \u00a0 In theory she was the person I was with that was just like mom &#8211; yet I don&#8217;t talk to my mother anymore either. \u00a0It just wasn&#8217;t going to work for the long haul.<\/p>\n<p>At some point while we were living together, one of her friends just left the military. \u00a0 He had a ton of money to spend since he had been overseas. \u00a0 For some reason, this guy I hardly knew, bought me the 1995 THX edition of the original trilogy. \u00a0 Later I would find out that he had a thing for Kim. \u00a0 Yet, I got a 100.00 collection of the Star Wars movies out of it. \u00a0 Was he trying to get brownie points with Kim by buying me gifts? \u00a0 Was he trying to get brownie points with me so he could go out to the bar with Kim without me saying boo (I wasn&#8217;t of age yet)? \u00a0 Don&#8217;t know &#8211; don&#8217;t care &#8211; I had Star Wars. \u00a0 I watched those videotapes so many times that I don&#8217;t really care what they ended up doing or not doing. \u00a0 She isn&#8217;t on my list of highly regarded people anyways.<\/p>\n<p>It was almost three years since I had last seen the movies in the theater. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Special Editions of the original trilogy were being released. \u00a0 I was still dating Kim (unfortunately). \u00a0I was ecstatic that I would get a chance to see these in the theater again. \u00a0 I was going to go on opening day and have a blast. \u00a0 I was going to take a light saber, make some Jedi robes, and embrace the geekdom that surrounds and binds all the die-hard fans together. \u00a0 But there was Kim&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p>Kim and I had purchased light sabers when they first came out. \u00a0I hoped it would, but it never filled that void of the lost light saber of my youth. \u00a0While Kim\u00a0would take hers up to the haunted schoolhouse, she was embarrassed of it. \u00a0 This was flying a geek flag being a twenty-something with a light saber and she did not let that flag fly. \u00a0She started making rules about the opening of the movie. \u00a0 There would be no costumes or she wouldn&#8217;t attend. \u00a0 All light sabers can go, but they had to stay in the car. \u00a0 There would be playing in line. \u00a0 It was like this person didn&#8217;t know me at all.<\/p>\n<p>The problem lied in the fact that I was about fifteen\u00a0miles from the theater in Sandusky, OH. \u00a0 I was twenty years old, but I never got around to getting my license. \u00a0 I would sometimes drive her car illegally without a license, but I couldn&#8217;t take it that day. \u00a0 Muska was busy that day and couldn&#8217;t go. \u00a0 I couldn&#8217;t find another ride that was available. \u00a0I had to concede to her rules &#8211; though I did embarrass her by doing Star Wars lines with the crowd while we waited to be let into the theater.<\/p>\n<p>I know I saw them all opening day, but I don&#8217;t remember if I attended all of them with Kim. \u00a0 I never dressed up. \u00a0 I never took a light saber. \u00a0 I was shamed in the fact that I would participate in the culture, but was still silenced. \u00a0 A few months later I finally got my license and my own car. \u00a0 A few months after that I broke up with Kim, started dating the girl who would become my wife, and never looked back.<\/p>\n<p>The girl who would my future wife was someone who didn&#8217;t care about what people thought if she was carrying a light saber around. \u00a0She was someone that wouldn&#8217;t necessary wallow in the Star Wars geekdom mire &#8211; but would happily watch me do it. \u00a0I could let the Star Wars flag fully fly. \u00a0Granted, she is someone who identifies more in the Star Trek universe &#8211; but not everyone can be perfect.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94876\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/EPI_TPM_poster-1-1-683x1024.png\" alt=\"EPI_TPM_poster\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/EPI_TPM_poster-1-1-683x1024.png 683w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/EPI_TPM_poster-1-1-200x300.png 200w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/EPI_TPM_poster-1-1-768x1152.png 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/EPI_TPM_poster-1-1-1024x1536.png 1024w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/EPI_TPM_poster-1-1-1070x1605.png 1070w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/EPI_TPM_poster-1-1.png 1230w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With the Special Edition movies being a success it was announced that a new trilogy was being created. \u00a0This one was going to be telling the story of Darth Vader. \u00a0 We were all extremely excited. \u00a0 I went down and purchased four tickets for the midnight showing of A Phantom Menace. \u00a0 The movie was being shown at Midway Mall cinemas in Elyria, Ohio. \u00a0I took my wife Xie, Griffaw, and Josh from work. \u00a0 We waited forever for Josh to show up at the theater as the lines were getting longer and longer. \u00a0 They were showing the movie on three &#8211; four screens. \u00a0People were in costume. \u00a0 Storm Troopers wandered about. \u00a0It actually was the crowd I had hoped the Special Edition would have been. \u00a0Star Wars set it&#8217;s flag in the sand and out came what will be a series that will never be put down.<\/p>\n<p>Of course there are haters that will state they have always hated the prequels. \u00a0 Did I enjoy episode one as much as the original trilogy &#8211; no. \u00a0 But, Star Wars is Star Wars. \u00a0 We had something new; we had to wrap our heads around Midichlorians. \u00a0 We had to deal with Jar-Jar being added for kids the same way Ewoks were added years before. \u00a0 It didn&#8217;t matter. \u00a0 Watching Obi-Wan and Qui Gon Jin in the opening of the movie was enough to tell us Star Wars was back.<\/p>\n<p>I got to wander through toy aisles and see Star Wars figures again. \u00a0Things were great and since that time in 1999 Star Wars hasn&#8217;t been able to be silenced again. \u00a0It has been pushed to the side a bit, but it hasn&#8217;t gone away. \u00a0 That really is the important part of leaving a lasting legacy.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94877\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Star-Wars-Episode-II-Attack-of-the-Clones-theatrical-poster-1-771x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Star-Wars-Episode-II-Attack-of-the-Clones-theatrical-poster\" width=\"640\" height=\"850\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Star-Wars-Episode-II-Attack-of-the-Clones-theatrical-poster-1-771x1024.jpg 771w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Star-Wars-Episode-II-Attack-of-the-Clones-theatrical-poster-1-226x300.jpg 226w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Star-Wars-Episode-II-Attack-of-the-Clones-theatrical-poster-1-768x1020.jpg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Star-Wars-Episode-II-Attack-of-the-Clones-theatrical-poster-1-1070x1422.jpg 1070w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Star-Wars-Episode-II-Attack-of-the-Clones-theatrical-poster-1.jpg 1129w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By the time Attack of the Clones was released we had relocated across the country. \u00a0I had a job at Symantec and the team I was on would go see the big geek movies as a group. \u00a0We did it with the Lord of the Rings movies; we also did it with Episode II. \u00a0We purchased tickets to the evening showing as a group and about thirty of us went together. \u00a0We went to the theater at Springfield Mall in Oregon. \u00a0This was the first time I saw a Star Wars movies with not just my fandom peers, but a large section of work peers also.<\/p>\n<p>The very next day my Brother-in-Law came down to visit for a few days. \u00a0 What did we do? \u00a0We went and saw Episode 2 again. \u00a0 I really think the best part of this experience was watching the crowd go wild when Yoda went into battle. \u00a0 No one was expecting it, but at both showings I saw that weekend the crowd cheered. \u00a0It was a collective emotion gasping for release.<\/p>\n<p>Since the release of A Phantom Menace there was discussions of a MMO coming out to take place in the Star Wars universe. \u00a0 On June 25th, 2003 a co-worker came back from lunch. \u00a0He had a copy of Star Wars Galaxies. \u00a0 Immediately I told my boss that I was going on lunch break. \u00a0 I went to Springfield Mall in Oregon and purchased two copies of the game. \u00a0Since this was an MMO we couldn&#8217;t do the normal buy a single copy and put it on two computers method we did in the past. \u00a0 When I got back to office I immediately called my wife and told her the news. \u00a0 We were both excited and knew what we would be doing that night.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of the weekend we had characters on the Intrepid server. \u00a0 \u00a0I went by Creeva Murkado and my wife was Xie &#8216;lanthia. \u00a0I wrote a few pieces on Star Wars Galaxies over the years. \u00a0The best article I can refer you to a piece called Intrepid History &#8211; An Entertainer&#8217;s Farewell (read it here). \u00a0It was an important part of my life. \u00a0My wife considers herself Xie and refers to her given name as her slave name. \u00a0 I could rehash and do a few thousand words on it here again, but I&#8217;ll save that for another time. \u00a0 We lived and breathed in that universe. \u00a0 For the fans it solidified the feelings they always had. \u00a0 On Facebook and other places online I&#8217;m still friends when many of the people I knew from the game. \u00a0 They are people that will be with me always &#8211; all because of that shared love for Star Wars.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94878\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/RevengeOfTheSithPoster-1-687x1024.jpg\" alt=\"RevengeOfTheSithPoster\" width=\"640\" height=\"954\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/RevengeOfTheSithPoster-1-687x1024.jpg 687w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/RevengeOfTheSithPoster-1-201x300.jpg 201w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/RevengeOfTheSithPoster-1-768x1146.jpg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/RevengeOfTheSithPoster-1-1030x1536.jpg 1030w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/RevengeOfTheSithPoster-1-1070x1596.jpg 1070w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/RevengeOfTheSithPoster-1.jpg 1373w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In 2005 Revenge of the Sith was released. \u00a0This would be the first of the prequels that I wouldn&#8217;t make it to the midnight showing on. \u00a0 Because of work obligations that kept me up all night we had to go in the morning. \u00a0 At the theater located at Valley River Center in Eugene, we saw the first showing of the movie the next day. \u00a0This movie was the best of the prequels.<\/p>\n<p>To say I like it would be too shallow of a statement. \u00a0 Of the whole story arc, this is my second favorite (The Empire Strikes Back being the first). \u00a0This is the movie that the other two built up to. \u00a0 Unfortunately since it was the first showing of the day and not the midnight release, the theater wasn&#8217;t packed. \u00a0 It lost a bit of being &#8220;in the experience&#8221;. \u00a0It was great being in attendance of the\u00a0collective enjoyment of that\u00a0special moment. \u00a0 Because of the harshness and pain as Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader (pre-classic dark outfit) it is the only movie my son hasn&#8217;t seen yet. \u00a0We talked to him about it a few weeks ago. \u00a0We explained our reservations and asked what he thought. \u00a0 He opted to wait a bit longer to watch this one.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94879\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/The_Clone_Wars_film_poster-1-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"The_Clone_Wars_film_poster\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/The_Clone_Wars_film_poster-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/The_Clone_Wars_film_poster-1-200x300.jpg 200w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/The_Clone_Wars_film_poster-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/The_Clone_Wars_film_poster-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/The_Clone_Wars_film_poster-1-1070x1605.jpg 1070w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/The_Clone_Wars_film_poster-1.jpg 1365w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There had been discussions of a live action Star Wars TV shows before Revenge of the Sith was released. \u00a0 We are still waiting for that today. \u00a0In 2008 in preparation for a new animated show Star Wars The Clone Wars was released in theaters. \u00a0 I like to refer to it as the forgotten Star Wars film. \u00a0It takes place between Episode 2 and Episode 3 and it continued on with a TV Show by the same name. \u00a0Xie and I saw this on opening day at the theater in Ontario, OH. \u00a0 It had a very light crowd because it wasn&#8217;t hyped that much. \u00a0Honestly, until I got there I didn&#8217;t even know it was animated.<\/p>\n<p>I can say I walked out of the theater saying that it felt right. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t like the sub-story about the baby Hutt &#8211; but I don&#8217;t have to like every single nuance of the Star Wars universe. \u00a0 This movie showed us that there was hope for more Star Wars movies. \u00a0Since the prequels turned the first six movies into Anakin&#8217;s story &#8211; there was a sense of completion to it all. \u00a0 There was talk of future movies taking place after Return of the Jedi &#8211; but that is all it was, talk. \u00a0A few months after I had the TV show &#8211; I was expecting that is as good as it was going to get.<\/p>\n<p>In 2009 Xie and I had a child. \u00a0 I did get shot down on baby names such as Luke, Han, Anakin &#8211; but this kid was going to grow Star Wars. \u00a0 He did not watch the movies in his first year of life like I did &#8211; but before his second birthday the Star Wars bug bit him. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t even my direct fault.<\/p>\n<p>We were feeding him in a high chair and I was playing through the Super Bowl commercials that year. \u00a0The kid Darth Vader VW commercial came on and he was transfixed. \u00a0He wanted to watch it over and over again. \u00a0 He had his first experience of Star Wars and wanted into that world.<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center>At ages two, three, and four he wanted to be Darth Vader for Halloween. \u00a0 Xie and I dressed up along with him. \u00a0 The first couple times we were dark Jedi leading on our master. \u00a0The Imperial marched played from the phone in my pocket and he marched as if he was Lord Vader. \u00a0 He would only break character when no one was around or if he had removed the mask. \u00a0Later on we bought nice Stormtrooper helmets (I have yet to buy a full outfit) ad escorted him around with the Imperial March still going.<\/p>\n<p>He did take a year off in 2014 to be Iron Patriot since he loves Iron Man. \u00a0This year however I got to put back on the Stormtrooper helmet and escort Kylo Ren around the neighborhood retrieving candy. \u00a0 The Imperial March was still blaring &#8211; but that&#8217;s because there hasn&#8217;t been a theme released for Kylo Ren. \u00a0 It is interesting watching him at this age. \u00a0Kylo Ren to him is what Darth Vader is to me. \u00a0 Though I identified more with the Rebel Alliance, he identifies more with the Imperial Order. \u00a0 To each their own.<\/p>\n<p>When he was a year old he stayed over at my father&#8217;s for Halloween. \u00a0Since he was so young we weren&#8217;t going to take him around the neighborhood. \u00a0My father happened to take him out to an event in Reynoldsburg. \u00a0 They stuck him in a chicken costume and I guess he enjoyed the evening. \u00a0 My father did make sure that he sent a picture of my one-year-old son and a Stormtrooper. \u00a0 Maybe he was always destined, regardless of my love for the series.<\/p>\n<p>When my son was\u00a0almost three he got to see his first Star Wars film in the theater. \u00a0Well, kind of. \u00a0 It was announced that they were going to re-release all the Star Wars movies in 3-D. \u00a0 The only one they actually got around to releasing was The Phantom Menace. \u00a0 Opening Day we took Lex to the Palace Theater in Lorain to see it. \u00a0 It was a later showing and Lex was three years old. \u00a0 He fell asleep before the Pod Race ever occurred. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t think I fell asleep during Empire Strikes Back &#8211; but hopefully for my parents I did during A New Hope. \u00a0At least he will be able to say he was there.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Lex has watched through most of The Clone Wars episodes and some of Star Wars Rebels. \u00a0 He has a menagerie of toys &#8211; and since I found them on clearance a few years ago, a whole army of Stormtroopers. \u00a0 He is a Star Wars addict through and through. \u00a0During Force Friday we went out early and did the Toys R Us and Target visits. \u00a0 That was when he decided that Kylo Ren was his go to Halloween costume. \u00a0He is my little Imperial, unfortunately he doesn&#8217;t get to see The Force Awakens opening day.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing that Revenge of the Sith was a bit rough and he likely wouldn&#8217;t be able to do a late night, we opted not to take him opening day. \u00a0 Xie and I are going and bearing through the crowds to keep the tradition of seeing it opening day. \u00a0 I know that there are Thursday night showings, but I purposely wanted to see it on opening day &#8211; the 18th. \u00a0 I purchased my tickets the day the pre-release went on sale. \u00a0We are going to be seeing it in Ontario, OH at 10:20PM.<\/p>\n<p>We are hoping that there is no extreme violence from taking him to see the movie. \u00a0If that&#8217;s true we are going to try and take him on Sunday. \u00a0 If not it will be over Christmas break. \u00a0 He&#8217;s not going to get into the excitement of the crowd yet. \u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping that maybe the next one he will be seeing on opening day.<\/p>\n<p>When Disney purchased Lucasfilm and Star Wars it was hard. \u00a0 At first was fear &#8211; the fear that they would Disneyfy the universe. \u00a0 Then I looked to the Marvel movies and many of these fears were alleviated. \u00a0The second was what does this mean? \u00a0 Well in retrospect it will be good &#8211; overmarketed but good. \u00a0 I do have a bit of anger in the fact that they removed the extended universe canon. \u00a0That was one of the key points of the Star Wars Universe &#8211; everything that was published was canon. \u00a0Some of it good or bad, but it was all canon. \u00a0It took me a bit to get over that &#8211; but I&#8217;ll let it go for now. \u00a0 I just hope I get what I need out of the new movies.<\/p>\n<p>What do I hope out of the movie? \u00a0 I hope I get the same thing I got out of the prequels. \u00a0 No matter what someone feels about the quality of the prequels, they did what they needed to. \u00a0 Every Star Wars movie transported me. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t care about Jar Jar or trade negotiations. \u00a0 All those fell to the background. \u00a0 I was a kid playing in a sand box and flying a TIE fighter without wings around the house. \u00a0 I was on the playground jungle gym believing it was the Millennium Falcon. \u00a0I was yearning for the Gold Circle lightsaber I never got. \u00a0 I was a kid again. \u00a0As long as it can make me feel that, I don&#8217;t really care about the overall plot.<\/p>\n<p>May The Force Be With You, Always.<\/p>\n<p>With the exception of the first image and the movie posters, all the rest are prints by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jameshance.com\/\">James Hance<\/a>. \u00a0 I have these hanging on the walls of my house. \u00a0 If you find them interesting, you can pick them up at this website &#8211;\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.jameshance.com\/\">www.jameshance.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Star Wars has been an active part of my life literally as long as I can remember. \u00a0 There hasn&#8217;t been a time since I&#8217;ve been able to remember that Star Wars hasn&#8217;t been a &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94866,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94865"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=94865"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94865\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94866"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=94865"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=94865"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=94865"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
