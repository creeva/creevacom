At this point the encryption is destroyed and the network path is no longer encrypted. \u00a0 \u00a0All communication must then be re-initiated &#8211; with a new key.<\/p>\n<p>The downside is that you can&#8217;t implement on the public internet today. \u00a0 You need specialized equipment on each end and in-between the clients. \u00a0 Essentially what China is doing is being a secure interconnection between valuable targets. \u00a0 This is the same as SSL and a VPN without the vulnerabilities that each of these technologies share. \u00a0 However, once a computer starts talking to machines outside of the secure channel &#8211; they are as vulnerable as any other system today. \u00a0 Only the specific communication is unhackable. \u00a0 \u00a0I&#8217;m really looking for this technology to come out to be mainstream so I can play with it at home.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Earlier today I received an email from a public relations person that I work with. \u00a0 The only text was &#8220;Scary&#8221; and this was the Hyperlink &#8211; China to launch hack-proof quantum communication network &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93680,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94064"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=94064"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94064\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93680"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=94064"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=94064"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=94064"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
