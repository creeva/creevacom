is the first novel to make it on the New York Times bestseller list that has also been released with a creative commons license.\u00a0 This means anyone can publish the book on their site and give it away, completely free and completely legal.\u00a0 The second thing is this novel has secured a sale for me.\u00a0 This week I plan on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0765319853\/102-1001606-6591343?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=creswor20-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0765319853\">ordering 2-3 copies of &#8220;Little Brother&#8221; from Amazon.com<\/a>; one to keep (and try to get signed), one to give as a gift, and one that I will use as my loaner novel.\u00a0 The third and final thing is that I have my mother-in-law agreed to read it (though the print version is going to be easier to navigate for her than a digital copy).<\/p>\n<p>After reading the novel I had a discussion about the novel with my mother-in-law.\u00a0 Part of the problem that she has always had is that she never understood the legal system and government&#8217;s powers that have been given in the last seven years and how they pertain to her.\u00a0 She&#8217;s been one of those people that state they have done nothing wrong, so the government would never peer into her life.\u00a0 I explained how this is wrong and how this book can show what soon would be possible.\u00a0\u00a0 She thought using cash would keep her anonymous, I explained that with trend tracking stores like Walmart can tell their customers apart by the items they purchase, even if they are using cash.\u00a0 People like my in-laws do all their shopping one day a week, they go to the same stores in the same order at about the same times every week.\u00a0\u00a0 Once at these stores, they buy certain things every week.\u00a0\u00a0 I explained how if the stores were plugged into a government agency that even using cash would not keep them anonymous.\u00a0\u00a0 The stores could aggregate the data, get customer profiles, go over weeks of data and see certain flags that identify the person, and one video camera which goes through facial recognition software would put them forever into a database.\u00a0 She thought that this was fantasy until I started mentioning WalMart&#8217;s trend analysis that they do, and how this is a pretty accurate portrayal of who you are and what you are likely to buy.\u00a0\u00a0 This allowed me to convince her to give this book a chance.<\/p>\n<p>To pick up your own copy of &#8220;Little Brother&#8221;
