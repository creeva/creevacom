\u00a0I can&#8217;t even tell you the phone numbers or even what state some of mine live in.<\/p>\n<p>When I was a teenager, like most of my generation, I spent hours on the phone. \u00a0 Local phone calls were free and I wold tie up the line for hours. \u00a0Teenager for the most part don&#8217;t do that anymore. \u00a0 It is either texting or Facebook. \u00a0I&#8217;m expecting by the time my son is a teenager that it will be only Facebook or whatever it&#8217;s replacement is.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has become a major communication that has toppled main stays and staples of society. \u00a0 Even the term friend has changed. \u00a0Ten years ago the term had connotations that ranged from someone close to you through towards co-workers and some\u00a0acquaintances. \u00a0When we look at the modern teenager, these people will never lose touch with grade school friends unless they want to. \u00a0 That person that lent your kid a bucket in the sandbox, yeah in forty-years they will be arguing over politics and living three thousand miles apart. \u00a0 They may not even see each other again in person after the bucket. \u00a0 They will stay in touch though.<\/p>\n<p>Just from a communication stand point, being able to have access to a number of close to a billion users is not something that shouldn&#8217;t be taken seriously. \u00a0The United States Postal Service only handles delivery of messages to less than a third of that. \u00a0 The volume of the USPS delivery is also a fraction of what you receive in your average Facebook news feed daily.<\/p>\n<p>News is also a big item on Facebook. \u00a0If you setup your account correctly with the right news feeds, you can replace going to other spots for news. \u00a0 This could entail right-wing news, left-wing news, moderate news, sports, geek news, and everything else under the sun. \u00a0 In some ways (<em>sadly<\/em>) some people could get by without visiting any other page. \u00a0 Not only did Facebook replace quite a bit of communication, it has replaced the newspaper and television news as a delivery service of information.<\/p>\n<p>This audience also makes Facebook big business. \u00a0 We are all aware of the advertisements that Facebook keeps trying to increase in frequency. \u00a0They do this to increase their profit margin. \u00a0 Lot&#8217;s of companies put money into Facebook just because of the audience size. \u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052702304192704577406394017764460.html\">Not all the companies investing in the advertising think it is a good value<\/a>. \u00a0You can not argue with the exposure though.<\/p>\n<p>What about the other companies that aren&#8217;t a huge contributor to the ad revenue. \u00a0It&#8217;s easy to talk about Fortune 500 companies and Facebook billionaires, but the ecosystem created by the social network has spawned an online app ecosystem. \u00a0This ecosystem has created many other billionaires and millionaires in their own right. \u00a0 Most of the companies don&#8217;t pay for advertising other than spamming your friends list. \u00a0We all complain about the messages. \u00a0The key thing to remember though, if you&#8217;re not paying for something, then you are the product.<\/p>\n<p>Finally we get into the terms of social\u00a0responsibility. \u00a0We are told to keep our feeds private and to be careful what we post. \u00a0 That a simple search in the future will expose that you were drunk five years ago at a party and you won&#8217;t get hired. \u00a0 These social norms will also change over the time. \u00a0 They are important for the moment. \u00a0 None of us wants to be banned from a job today because there is a picture of a red cup in our hands.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the inertia of Facebook, pressure extends beyond being careful what you post. \u00a0 At first it was your friends and family pressuring you to join. \u00a0 They wanted to share with you and comment with you. \u00a0 The volume however makes matter worse than being\u00a0harassed\u00a0by your friends. \u00a0It is beginning to become suspicious if you don&#8217;t have a Facebook account.<\/p>\n<p>All day long you can look at silly pictures and get into mock debates with your friends, but this isn&#8217;t something that was as easy of a task ten years ago. \u00a0Can&#8217;t sleep? \u00a0 Roll over in bed and discuss a pop culture show with your friends on the other side of the globe. \u00a0 Want to know the Olympic highlights? \u00a0Just ask and you&#8217;ll be given links within minutes. \u00a0 Want to lose friends? \u00a0Just discuss your political ideals and you will get unfriended. \u00a0 All of this happens in an average day. \u00a0The frequency of course is dependent on your social graph.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from Wikipedia The other day someone on my friend list was unfriended by someone else. \u00a0 There response that the other person should just grow up, it&#8217;s just Facebook. \u00a0 I thought about that &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93475,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93474"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93474"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93474\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93475"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93474"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93474"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93474"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
