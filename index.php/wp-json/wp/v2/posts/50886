a town Qitu would later be mayor of.\u00a0\u00a0 Somewhere around late 03 \/ early 04 Padre announced he was leaving the game.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m not sure I remember why.\u00a0 When he was leaving the game he wanted to make sure three things were all set and would continue after he left the game.\u00a0 The first being his guild, the second\u00a0was Serenity Valley, and finally the Intrepid History Museum.<\/p>\n<p>To insure that I had everything of I needed from his item collection, I was taken on a tour of store houses in Serenity Valley.\u00a0 Wandering from storage house to storage factory we went through items I needed and what he would leave behind.\u00a0\u00a0 While we were out jumping around and weighing down my inventory, Padre got pulled aside for city business.\u00a0\u00a0 Up comes this person to discuss the city and I&#8217;m 99% sure this was Q and it was our first in-game meeting.\u00a0 If I&#8217;m correct it was the first meeting where a conversation would have occurred.\u00a0 So now she can tell me if I&#8217;m right or on crack.<\/p>\n<p>Qitu is someone I know by many names and has been a friend for years.\u00a0\u00a0 While we never will be best buds, it will be the kind of friendship where we&#8217;ll catch up from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0 It is the kind of friendship I can see going on until one of us passes.\u00a0\u00a0 It&#8217;s low maintenance and in that sense there will never really be the drama that are\u00a0in other closer friendships.\u00a0\u00a0 It is a friendship I have never regretted and would be a bit emptier than I would have been if I never met her.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
