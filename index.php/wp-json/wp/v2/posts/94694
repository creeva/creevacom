if pure raw backup with no organization is what you want, get Dropbox, Google Photo Uploader, and Flickr Uploader. \u00a0 Dropbox will import the images from your phone. \u00a0 Have Google and Flickr watch the import folder and automatically upload them to their respective services. \u00a0 More detail below, but that is the down and dirty on how not to lose images.<\/p>\n<p>Now, onto my process&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The first piece of software I use is <a href=\"http:\/\/dropbox.com\">Dropbox<\/a>. \u00a0 I have some storage I use on Dropbox, but not really for images. \u00a0Dropbox has a nice feature that copies all images from your device to a folder named camera uploads. \u00a0Every time I plugin my phone my images are at least saved on my computer. \u00a0 At this point I use <a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\">Flickr Uploader<\/a>. \u00a0 This software monitors the Dropbox folder and automatically uploads all the images to Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>At this point you could move your images to another folder for backup locally. \u00a0Remember, it&#8217;s not a backup unless it is in at least two places. \u00a0 One of those places is preferably offsite. \u00a0However, I have this phobia of my laptop and Flickr dying at the same time. \u00a0 Because of this I do some additional steps.<\/p>\n<p>I start by sorting all images on Flickr into individual\u00a0months. \u00a0 The reason for this is that it makes it easier for me to go back and search time frames. \u00a0Here is where I use something that costs money &#8211; a piece of software called <a href=\"http:\/\/clipyourphotos.com\/bulkr\">Bulkr<\/a>. \u00a0This software let&#8217;s me download complete albums from Flickr. \u00a0It downloads them and places them into a folder with the Album name. \u00a0 Since my folders are May 2015, April 2014, etc. I have them locally complete and organized just like on Flickr. \u00a0Now it&#8217;s time for the split.<\/p>\n<p>I sort through the images and do a monthly folder on Facebook. \u00a0I don&#8217;t post all images, but the bulk of them. \u00a0My current image count on Facebook is approaching 10k. \u00a0 I have 40k images on my laptop and on Flickr. \u00a0 After the Facebook dump is complete I upload my photos to Google. \u00a0 I use the <a href=\"https:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/lh\/myphotos\">old Picasa Website<\/a>, the only reason I do this is so I can easily dump them into albums that match Flickr.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day my images are all sorted on my hard drive, Flickr, (mostly on) Facebook, and Google Photos. I understand this sounds long and complicated, but there are a couple of shortcuts.<\/p>\n<p>If you are not worried about album naming &#8211; you could use the process I mentioned in the beginning of just raw backups using Dropbox, Google, and Flickr. \u00a0This won&#8217;t organize them, but you will have your photos backed up to these services for retrieval. \u00a0I only share on Facebook to share with friends and family. \u00a0By not uploading manually at all anywhere &#8211; this is a completely transparent process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not a month goes by where someone I know hasn&#8217;t broken a phone or lost pictures on their computer. \u00a0 I would say about 80% of the time a solution is found and they manage &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94695,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94694"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=94694"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94694\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94695"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=94694"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=94694"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=94694"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
