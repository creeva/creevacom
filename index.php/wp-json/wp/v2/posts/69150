Take The Risk"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Saturday night I was at a party and while it was a good time, the great moment of the evening is when things are winding down and the discussions start getting pulled out. \u00a0 \u00a0People are all in different states of inebriation and some of them accidentally let there guards down. \u00a0There are others that purposely let their guards down, but pretend it&#8217;s accidental. \u00a0 \u00a0Regardless of how it gets to that point, that is where some of the honest conversations come out of the evening.<\/p>\n<p>There was a circle of us talking about careers, where we have been and where we are going on. \u00a0 I went in the mode of just asking questions and there was three people at different spots in their life that had three different views on where they have been and where they are going. \u00a0 So while the conversations were anything but linear, I am going to do my best to make them that way.<\/p>\n<p>I should preface this with the fact that I am anti-college for most scenarios. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t make it past my first year in school and even if I had finished it wouldn&#8217;t have helped my career. \u00a0There is a chance I could have made maybe 5% than I do now, but saddled with student debt I don&#8217;t think it would have evened out in my lifetime. \u00a0 It does mean I had to work harder to get to where I am, but I have a respectable career with a respectable salary. \u00a0 I also spent a bit of time making the correct resume and choosing my jobs a bit (when I could) based on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and the goal.<\/p>\n<p>When I was around 24 I made a goal to reach a certain job with a certain income level by the time I was 30. \u00a0 Fudging numbers in a way I didn&#8217;t mean when I set the goal &#8211; I reached this by the time I was 29. \u00a0 I legitimately reached the same goal when I was 33. \u00a0 So depending on how you want to slice it I either reached it early or late. \u00a0 For those that are interested in the journey, I just ended up taking the longer path. \u00a0I also got screwed over doing the same job for a bit less money working up through the ranks instead of getting hired form the outside. \u00a0For those concerned about reaching the destination &#8211; I made it.<\/p>\n<p>The first was someone who had recently gone back to school in his thirties. \u00a0 He is doing well, and realizes that for him that school is more for the contacts than the direct learning. \u00a0 His contact list is growing and seems to be working out for him. \u00a0 He is going for film and is realizes he is lucky to be at this point in history. \u00a0If things don&#8217;t work out career wise, he can still fulfill his dreams and do it online. \u00a0 He can do this and make supplemental or primary income. \u00a0 If he gets the big break and is pulled from the minors and into the majors, the world will be his oyster. \u00a0He wants to create, he wants to grow, and he knows where he wants to be in 5-10 years. \u00a0 I also hope the best for him.<\/p>\n<p>The next person was a guy in twenties complaining that all companies care about is the paper. \u00a0 He doesn&#8217;t have the college degree (he doesn&#8217;t seem like going for it either). \u00a0 He is also in computers so I can speak with some authority that you do not need a degree if you want to get the work done. \u00a0 \u00a0The confusing thing about it, is that he is happy where he is. \u00a0 He wants more, but it&#8217;s in the abstract. \u00a0 He doesn&#8217;t know where he wants to be in 10 years &#8211; but he wants more. \u00a0I explained to him the climbing through the ranks for compensation &#8211; he&#8217;s just stuck on the need for a degree that can be overcome.<\/p>\n<p>He can volunteer and work on some online projects to pad out the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and get some legitimate experience. \u00a0 He can offer a non-profit to do work as needed. \u00a0 Anything to get that resume working in a way that will show any future he has experience and doesn&#8217;t need the paper. \u00a0 All a degree can really get you is your first job, after that a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is all that required and can compensate. \u00a0 I also asked if he was happy where he worked. \u00a0 He said he loved it, he also was excited about a work conference he was being sent to.<\/p>\n<p>I asked him if he was happy why does he need to move. \u00a0 He didn&#8217;t know. \u00a0 Society has ingrained into us that we need to always be moving, to make more money, to have bigger and better things. \u00a0 I&#8217;m working now and trying to slim down my life, but with better quality things. \u00a0 So less, but with roughly the same cost in the end. \u00a0 I explained to him that once you find where you are happy I wouldn&#8217;t look further until you truly didn&#8217;t enjoy your job. \u00a0 Don&#8217;t give into the pressure. \u00a0If you find something you enjoy (and your job isn&#8217;t in danger), keep at it and enjoy it.<\/p>\n<p>The last person was the youngest and she wasn&#8217;t sure. \u00a0 I asked her what she wanted to do in ten years and she said she wanted to be a pirate. \u00a0 I asked her what was stopping her? \u00a0 She didn&#8217;t know where to begin. \u00a0 I immediately offered up that learning to sail might be a good start. \u00a0 At this point she admitted to now being serious and said she wanted to be a forensic scientist. \u00a0 \u00a0So I asked what is she doing towards that goal. \u00a0 She didn&#8217;t know where to start. \u00a0 I said that is definitely a career you need to go to school for, so I would at least enroll and get the starter stuff out-of-the-way.<\/p>\n<p>This highlights the point that this piece was leading to. \u00a0 She hasn&#8217;t started, because she doesn&#8217;t want to start the wrong way. \u00a0 There is no wrong way. \u00a0 It is either about the journey or the destination. \u00a0 The journey is what truly makes you. \u00a0The destination is just the top of the mountain where there is nothing left to do. \u00a0You can see the clouds below you &#8211; but what do you do next? \u00a0You are not going to sit on the mountain top forever. \u00a0Eventually you need to start the journey again my climbing down and back up again. \u00a0 It should never end until you die. \u00a0To keep with the analogy &#8211; the first person is on his way to the top, the second one likes the party going on at the encampment part way up the mountain, the last is looking for a sherpa and doesn&#8217;t know if she wants to leave the base camp party yet.<\/p>\n<p>Too many people are worried about success. \u00a0 Society has taught us if you don&#8217;t do something well you are a failure. \u00a0That failure is a bad thing. \u00a0Just ignore him, he&#8217;s a failure. \u00a0 What is wrong with that? \u00a0You learn from failure, and the only true success in life is constantly learning. \u00a0 He who knows the most is the one that truly wins. \u00a0 Once you stop learning you better enjoy where you&#8217;ve stopped &#8211; there is no going forward from that.<\/p>\n<p>There are two types of failure in my mind. \u00a0The first is failing big. \u00a0You fail big when you have invested so much of life\/time\/money into something that it absolutely destroys you for a bit. \u00a0 You feel like you can&#8217;t go on. \u00a0 You do. \u00a0 You have fallen down the mountain and you&#8217;ve learned which path not to take. \u00a0You may have quickly made it to the top, sometimes you have to take the big risk to get the big reward. \u00a0This truly something that gives you a setback that you can and will recover from.<\/p>\n<p>The second type of failure is failing often. \u00a0 You take little risks that if they don&#8217;t work out will only knock you back a bit. \u00a0 This is the failure I prefer. \u00a0My\u00a0livelihood would suck if I failed big &#8211; but I&#8217;m at the point I don&#8217;t need to take the big risk.\u00a0 \u00a0I can save the big risks now for side projects that I need to start working on again. \u00a0 \u00a0 Once I fail at something I put it behind me and don&#8217;t worry about. \u00a0 I\u00a0iterate\u00a0it to the next attempt at something else. \u00a0 Failing is how you learn your limits. \u00a0 If you are not failing at all , you are not trying at all.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a very laid back guy for the most part. \u00a0 When I was twenty I heard something that would ever change my life and I would do my best to live by:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>There are two things to worry about:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Things you can do nothing about<\/li>\n<li>Things you can do something about<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For the things you can do nothing about, accept it and realize no matter what you put into it &#8211; you can do nothing about it, so stop worrying about it.<\/p>\n<p>For the things you can do something about &#8211; do what needs to get done as quickly as possible, once it is done you can stop worrying about it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So fail often or fail big &#8211; your life is too short to worrying or fearing failing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Saturday night I was at a party and while it was a good time, the great moment of the evening is when things are winding down and the discussions start getting pulled out. \u00a0 \u00a0People &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/69150"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=69150"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/69150\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=69150"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=69150"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=69150"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
