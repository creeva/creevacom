I don&#8217;t know why.<\/p>\n<p>Following that for years I had inferior capes, normally the halloween vinyl capes. I hated those capes. They would tear within an hour and most the time you were left with the collar and no cape. Then I finally made it to working at the haunted school house (picture above though the cape is somehow behind my back enoguh you can&#8217;t see it).
