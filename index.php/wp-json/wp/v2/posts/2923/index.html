In some ways I&#8217;m living the normal expected life for my age group. I own a house and pay a mortgage. I have car payments. I have a job with a cubicle. I have an expectant wife. These things are all normal and fall within the expected time I should have them. Nothing out of the ordinary.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But I&#8217;m not ordinary. I&#8217;m not up to the trends and buying that people in my age group are. I&#8217;m more likely to buy a comic book then a mocha. I&#8217;m more likely to play a video game then play the stock market.

It&#8217;s really not like that thought. I still have a lot of the same interests I had in high school, I play video games, read comics, and play in the band. Yet it&#8217;s more responsibilities and I juggle these the best I can.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I hope I feel as young when I&#8217;m 64.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thirty-two &#8211; what a long strange trip it&#8217;s been.
