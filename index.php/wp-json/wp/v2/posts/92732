When I was young I always enjoyed Ocean Motion. It&#8217;s a giant swinging ride shaped like a Viking ship. I started riding this whatever year I became tall enough.<\/p>\n<p>Then in the later 1980s, a commercial came out from Miller Lite that changed the dynamics of Ocean Motion. That commercial became so popular that it was part of the Ocean Motion ride. The change wasn&#8217;t Cedar Point sponsored, it was all in the customers. When the first side went up they would yell &#8220;Tastes Great!&#8221;. Then as it swung around the other way, the other side would say &#8220;Less Filling!&#8221;. Even typing that out it sounds lame, but it was a good time. It was something so you could battle and state your side was the best. It was just something to have a friendly rivalry.<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center><center><\/center><center><\/center>I normally try to do my best to get on-ride footage, but I think the openness and stationary movement\u00a0makes it difficult for people to sneak their cameras on and grab footage. I&#8217;m not quite sure why Cedar Point hasn&#8217;t made an official POV, but all we have left to end with is exterior footage from the original and the new locations of the ride.<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center><center><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since Ocean Motion now occupies the old Demon Drop site, I thought this would be the best follow-up to the last story.
