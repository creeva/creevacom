Once I had to walk all the way, that was a pain. \u00a0 This at least passed another year of employment where I did not need a car. \u00a0 Eventually I left Beaver Park and got the job that started me on my current career path at PC Elite in Amherst.<\/p>\n<p>To make this job work I stayed at my grandparents sometimes and walk. \u00a0My grandparents occasionally dropped me off. \u00a0 If my girlfriend wasn&#8217;t working she would drop me off at work. \u00a0Eventually I just dropped my girlfriend off at her job and drove myself in (illegally). \u00a0 The problem was when work got to the point that they needed me to make service calls.<\/p>\n<p>I was approaching my twenty-first birthday and I did not have a car of my own. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t even have my license. \u00a0 I had a job in which I could afford a car, so it was time. \u00a0 My grandmother took me to the drivers testing station and I proceeded to take the exam.<\/p>\n<p>I took the written portion in under five minutes. \u00a0 My driving test was about an hour after that. \u00a0 I mentioned I used to drive my girlfriend to work. \u00a0This meant I was driving two hours a day for months. \u00a0 I was a fairly seasoned, albeit not licensed, driver at this point. \u00a0 The driving portion was going to be easy. \u00a0 I was relaxed, a bit too relaxed.<\/p>\n<p>Going out on the road person I wasn&#8217;t nervous at all. \u00a0 This meant I was driving like a real person. \u00a0 When you take a driving test you are not supposed to drive like a real person. \u00a0 You are supposed to be nervous and hyper analyzing everything you do. \u00a0 You are supposed to pay so close attention that you over compensate for everything. \u00a0 I was not doing that. \u00a0 I was relaxed.<\/p>\n<p>After a bit on the road course I noticed the examiner was making notes. It seems most of my stops were rolling stops (like all the other traffic around me). \u00a0 I caught on eventually and moved into hyper analyzing mode. \u00a0 If I had made one more mistake I would have failed. \u00a0 All because I drove like everyone does when they are not taking a test. \u00a0\u00a0Maneuverability\u00a0was a cake walk. \u00a0I had my license. \u00a0 \u00a0Now it was time to get my first car.<\/p>\n<p>My grandfather had offered to buy my first car. \u00a0The first vehicle I wanted was a jeep. \u00a0 My grandfather didn&#8217;t want to buy me a Jeep. \u00a0 He thought I should get something more practical. \u00a0 Granted in the end a Jeep might have been more practical. \u00a0 I then decided I wanted an Escort. \u00a0 One of my friends in high school had one and I loved it. \u00a0 I even survived a car wreck in it on the way to a marching band party.<\/p>\n<p>The friend from driver&#8217;s education also had one. \u00a0 He had the wagon model though. \u00a0 I can&#8217;t say how many accidents he had in that car. \u00a0 I can say that I was in the car for at least three of them. \u00a0One of them was being the center car in a three car pile-up. \u00a0 That thing could take a beating. \u00a0 Having survived at least two major and two minor accidents in an Escort, I was sold that this was the car I wanted.<\/p>\n<p>The first Escort my grandfather had me try was an EXP model. \u00a0The EXP was the Mustang version of the Escort. \u00a0 The car was located on a little lot by the roller rink south of Amherst. \u00a0It was sporty and quicker than the regular model. \u00a0I test drove it and it was ok. \u00a0It felt a little off though and I wasn&#8217;t sold. It was also 1500.00 and I wasn&#8217;t comfortable that my grandfather was going to pay that much for it. \u00a0I went back to looking.<\/p>\n<p>I managed to find another one in the paper for 500.00. \u00a0It was located on Sunnyside Road in Vermilion. \u00a0 We went out and I took it by myself for a test drive. \u00a0 It handled the way I expected it to. \u00a0 I had no problems or complaints with the car. \u00a0 \u00a0My grandfather talked him down to 450.00 and the car was sold. \u00a0 I now had my brand new car. \u00a0We are now up to the subject of this long post.<\/p>\n<p>My grandfather made sure I had insurance on the car, but that lasted about three months before I was driving uninsured. \u00a0There are two funny stories about driving around uninsured.<\/p>\n<p>The first story is about my first accident. \u00a0Eventually I need to write-up the great squirt gun wars story of 1997, but here is one of the final events. \u00a0 I was with my girlfriend and we had pulled into the Geyer&#8217;s parking lot. \u00a0 We were heading to K&amp;N. \u00a0 Our friend Andy, ran up to the car with a super soaker. \u00a0 I slammed the car into reverse and pushed the gas pedal down as far as I could. \u00a0 I slammed into a van driving behind me.<\/p>\n<p>According to friends that saw it, I knocked the van up off the ground momentarily and about three feet away. \u00a0 Not bad for a running distance of about eight feet in an eighty horsepower car. \u00a0 The cops were called, but they stated I couldn&#8217;t be cited because the parking lot was private property. \u00a0 I offered to pay damages but the guy never called me. \u00a0This was two days before my insurance expired.<\/p>\n<p>I had messed up my driver&#8217;s side rear quarter panel and tailight. \u00a0 I fixed that with the colored transparent tape from the auto parts stores. \u00a0 You could still see daylight in the rear through the bit of mangled metal. \u00a0In the winter the heater worked overtime to keep the car warm after that.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after I started dating my future wife I was racing a friend&#8217;s escort on the Route 2. \u00a0 He was doing about eighty-five and I was doing a little under eighty. \u00a0 An officer was sitting at the exit at Sunnyside Road and clocked us. \u00a0 My friend noticed him, I slowed down when my friend did. \u00a0I got the ticket for eighty-five instead of eighty that I should have gotten. \u00a0 While we are waiting for the police officer to approach the car I confess to my date I don&#8217;t have insurance. \u00a0 Lucky for me the officer did not ask for it.<\/p>\n<p>I think the officer was distracted by the fact that the other Escort pulled over in front of me. \u00a0 The driver approached the officer and explained that the girl in my backseat (not my date) needed to get home. \u00a0 He asked if he could take her. \u00a0 The officer agreed and she left my car and went to the other one. \u00a0 My future wife stayed with me. \u00a0My thought process now is, what if the girl who got out of the car was carrying the drugs, guns, or something else illegal? \u00a0 If I would have had anything like that in my car &#8211; the officer would have just let it walk away.<\/p>\n<p>Maintenance\u00a0on the car was a breeze. \u00a0I could drive it for almost a week on five dollars. \u00a0 That is with commuting from Vermilion to Amherst every weekday and going out most nights. \u00a0 Over the two years I had it I also only changed the oil once or twice. \u00a0 The car had an oil leak. \u00a0 Every two weeks (when I got paid) the car was a quart low. \u00a0 I added a quart as part of my pay-day routine. \u00a0 The oil always looked clean so I never bothered changing it. \u00a0 I&#8217;m sure the filter would have looked like hell at the end though.<\/p>\n<p>One time a large group of us went down to Gore Orphanage during the day. \u00a0On the drive home a girl decided to ride with me. \u00a0 This girl who would later become my future wife was dating someone else. \u00a0 When we managed to get back home her boyfriend shows up. \u00a0 \u00a0I rev the engine and look him in the eyes and say I&#8217;m stealing his woman. \u00a0 While I didn&#8217;t ask her out until they were broken up, how prophetic it was.<\/p>\n<p>One night after we were dating we had a car load of people out driving. \u00a0 We were going down through Mill Hollow shortly after they widened the turn going down the hill. \u00a0 For some reason I had forgotten the fact they widened the road. \u00a0 We ended up driving through someone&#8217;s yard and almost over the hill because I was following the old path. \u00a0 This of course was shortly after I was stating how well I knew the roads. \u00a0I knew the roads so well I was driving on the ones that no longer existed.<\/p>\n<p>The car finally died after a major overheating attempt. \u00a0 I scrapped it and got 50.00 for it. \u00a0 I regret that decision now with every fiber of my being. \u00a0 I miss that car so much. \u00a0It managed to get me through blizzards. \u00a0 It survived Jim experimenting how to\u00a0neutral\u00a0drop a car. \u00a0 Speeding down Thompson Hill and on Risden Road were always fun times. \u00a0 Many of us had our initials carved into the paint on the top of the car. \u00a0 It was my car through some of the best years of my life.<\/p>\n<p>This whole post started with an article I read earlier about <a href=\"http:\/\/jalopnik.com\/5927172\/this-twin+engined-escort-is-a-little-lamborghini?tag=Car-Hacks\">someone who put two engines into his 1986 Escort<\/a>. \u00a0 This brought back all the flood of memories and how much I loved that car. \u00a0 I want to get another one. \u00a0 It was great on gas and I could use for my commute. \u00a0 The problem is finding one.<\/p>\n<p>This was one of the most popular cars produced in its first generation (1981-1990). \u00a0You would think out of the millions produced that there should be tons of these around. \u00a0Unfortunately it seems almost all of them have rusted away. \u00a0 I could not find a single one on E-Bay earlier. \u00a0Autotrader has a grand total of eight being sold in the United States, and not close enough or cheap enough to justify driving out for a test drive.<\/p>\n<p>One day I will find a mint low mileage one. \u00a0It will be mine. \u00a0 If it&#8217;s not mint I&#8217;ll restore it as much as possible and keep it from ever seeing salt on the roads ever again. \u00a0 I&#8217;m working under the assumption that millions of these cars just literally rusted away. \u00a0 To make matters worse I want my same setup. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t care the color, but it has to be an automatic and it cannot be an EXP.<\/p>\n<p>I only owned it two years, but I will always remember that car as being my first. \u00a0 They say you never forget your first. \u00a0 This is what they meant right?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll end this with some 1986 Ford Escort
