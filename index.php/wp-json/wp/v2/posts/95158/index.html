It was dial-up and hourly. &nbsp; Now I could have been like some people I know and use borrowed AOL credentials to dial the 800 number, this number charged per the minute. &nbsp; I didn&#8217;t do that. &nbsp; I had a shell account for awhile at The Well, but had to give that up due to funds. &nbsp; I logged into every BBS I could find locally and killed time that way to satisfy my drive of technology. &nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&#8217;t enough though.<\/p>\n<p>Then I found the backdoor I was looking for. &nbsp; I could get free Internet access at the library. &nbsp; This was in the days before it was a regular occurrence to use the library as your regular ISP. &nbsp; This was before the library even knew they had internet access. &nbsp; While always looking for new numbers to call with my modem, I found the dial-up number for the library the next town over. &nbsp; Most the libraries were all partner libraries with the Cleveland library. &nbsp;This was partnership was call Clevnet. &nbsp; I dialed into this local number one day and noticed that there was a standard Gopher address at the bottom. &nbsp; For those that don&#8217;t understand what Gopher is, it was a markup protocol similar to what the web uses today. &nbsp; By modifying the address I had almost complete shell access to the system and access to Lynx (a text based web browser).<\/p>\n<p>I could telnet, FTP, go to text based web pages. &nbsp; Further testing showed that the line would disconnect you after an hour or two, but you could dial right back in. &nbsp;I never received a busy signal &#8211; so in essence this was an internet connection all to myself. &nbsp; You didn&#8217;t even have to log into it with your library card, because who would spend hours browsing a card catalog. &nbsp; I connected to chat accounts, checked my email via an account I could telnet to. &nbsp; I could even download software slowly over this account. &nbsp; If I remember correctly I could download 5 megabytes to the library shell account and then download them to my computer from there. &nbsp; This was awesome for an internet starved poor boy like me.<\/p>\n<p>One day I was talking about it with a friend and he wanted to see it. &nbsp; I told him that since it was the standard card catalog software that we should be able to access it at the local library. &nbsp; Along the way (the way teenagers tend to do), we picked up a friend that came along with us just to hang out. &nbsp; She didn&#8217;t care about computers, but was there for the ride and wherever the wind would take her that day. &nbsp; When we got the library I asked the librarian if there was plans to get a dial-up line for the internet there. &nbsp; She told me they didn&#8217;t have Internet at all within the library, but it was planned to have access at the library computers in the next 2-3 years. &nbsp;My friend started to correct her, but I gave him a kick and he shut up.<\/p>\n<p>We wandered over to one of the computers that faced the bathrooms. &nbsp; I didn&#8217;t really care if a patron wandered by, but I didn&#8217;t want to get in trouble for exploiting a library computer. &nbsp; Our female friend then asked questions about what we doing. &nbsp; We explained it to her and at that point I discover that her mother works for the library. &nbsp; This would have been pertinent information to know earlier. &nbsp; She swore she wouldn&#8217;t say anything, and we continued. &nbsp; &nbsp;I modified the address and there I was telnetting into a chat server I knew about. &nbsp; We were talking to people around the world. &nbsp; I checked my email (because it was something cool you could do before everyone had an email address). &nbsp;Then we logged off after about a half hour. &nbsp;I can say that I&#8217;m likely the first person to access the internet at the Vermilion Public Library outside of the card catalog. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure the librarians thought it was so odd that three teenagers were spending so much time looking up a book on the computer.<\/p>\n<p>I was using the dial-up daily for months. &nbsp; I assumed they had a bank of modems, but that proved wrong in the long run. &nbsp; A few months later I had a friend that complained he hardly ever got a chance to talk to his sister in Hawaii. &nbsp; Phone calls were so expensive. &nbsp; His sister had internet access, but he didn&#8217;t even have a computer. &nbsp; So, out of extra parts I pieced together another computer and gave it to him. &nbsp;I taught him how to connect to the internet and he worked with his sister on how to use a chat site. &nbsp; Now, they could freely communicate.<\/p>\n<p>I managed to get home that evening and the line was busy. &nbsp; Oops. &nbsp; Instead of a bank of modems the library had a single one. &nbsp; I mean, how often and long were people going to login to the card catalog from their computers. &nbsp; I spent the next month playing cat and mouse getting in. &nbsp;When I had the connection I monopolized it all I could. &nbsp; After that month I could hardly ever get in. &nbsp; The dream was over since I shared the information. &nbsp; Access to the internet was once again sporadic. &nbsp; I could have gone down the library and done it from their computers &#8211; but I only ever did that the one time. &nbsp; I had to now find another way to access the Internet. &nbsp;Eventually I went through a few different methods of working outside of the system, and that lead to actually paying for an account around 2001. &nbsp; I did scrape by purloining access somewhat regularly through different methods for five years, so I couldn&#8217;t complain. &nbsp; At 20.00 a month (which at the start that wouldn&#8217;t even have been unlimited access only 20 hours a month) &#8211; I saved over 1200.00 and still had access. &nbsp; For those few months though with the library, it was my own private world.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ok the picture is from about 2-3 years after what I&#8217;m about to write about, but it is close to the correct time period.
