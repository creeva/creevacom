Since the meeting was ending soon I didn&#8217;t even look at the call and sent it straight to voice mail. As I left the meeting a few minutes later I walked out and saw it was Xie calling me. I called her as I was walking back to the car. Her mother had her and she was on the way to the hospital. I rushed back to my office and rushed through everything I had to get done, get the paperwork filed for the maternity leave I was taking and try to rush out there. Now my hiring company (I&#8217;m a contractor) was in town preparing for the following week to do performance reviews &#8211; while I was waiting for my boss to show back up they rushed me through my review. My boss finally appeared and I rushed him through what needed to be known and done, and had the paperwork signed. Thirty minutes after talking to Xie I was on the road to home. My commute was an hour, then another half hour to the hospital.<\/p>\n<p>When I got home I rushed taking out and feeding the pets since I wouldn&#8217;t be coming back that night. I also grabbed everything Xie and I needed, but she didn&#8217;t take with her. While the dogs were eating I managed to get out the announcement on the blog that we were heading to the hospital and things were happening. I had actually written that a couple weeks before but had it ready in preparation so that took only a few seconds to get it marked as published. Everything said and done, I was at the hospital about two hours after Xie.<\/p>\n<p>When I arrived she was in a staging area, where they get you ready to have a baby. A room where you are not far enough along to move into the next room. They had her on medications, but she was still feeling quite a bit of pain. Her mother was there comforting her and feeding her ice chips, essentially wrangling it so I couldn&#8217;t get in at all. Now I have stated that I may not always be the most comforting person in the world, but I didn&#8217;t have a chance. At one point Xie interjected and pleaded with me to talk to her. Now I&#8217;m normally a guy with too many words and would just keep talking about anything and everything, but I blanked &#8211; and felt like total crap over it.<\/p>\n<p>Continued in part 4 coming soon<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was in a meeting at work and around 3:45 a call came into my cell phone.
