Go to your account settings<\/p>\n<p>2. Go to mobile settings &#8211; here you can get your moblog address (which you can post to from any e-mail address) and the settings you wish to apply to it.<\/p>\n<p>3. Setup your account that you are crossposting from (which can be any service that sends out emails)<\/p>\n<p>There are two services I can recommend that you can use to post to Vox with (or bridge across with more on that around part 18), these are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blogspot.com\">Blogger<\/a> or a custom <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordpress.org\">wordpress<\/a> installation.<\/p>\n<p>For Blogger:<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0 Go into your blog&#8217;s settings<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 Go to your emai tab<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 Paste your Vox moblog email address<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0 Now any post that goes to your Blogger account (I&#8217;ll talk about crossposting to blogger in a later thread)<\/p>\n<p>For WordPress<\/p>\n<p>1. Download a plugin that allows for publishing via e-mail ( I use DJ EmailPublish)<\/p>\n<p>2. Go to your settings page and configure the plugin by pasting in the Vox moblog address<\/p>\n<p>3. Save and apply settings<\/p>\n<p>4. Now any post that goes up on your wordpress account crossposts over to your vox account.<\/p>\n<p>In part 3 I will be covering crossposting to live journal, so I hope to see you then.<\/p>\n<p>Previous Entries in The Crossposting God Series:<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Article-Link (Permalink)\" href=\"..\/2008\/05\/21\/the-crossposting-god-series-part-1-the-introduction\/\" rel=\"bookmark\">The Crossposting God Series Part 1 &#8211; The Introduction<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vox is a blog community that really focuses on the community aspect.\u00a0\u00a0 When Xie first started blogging on vox I kind of poo-pooed it.\u00a0\u00a0 However, I didn&#8217;t find some people that I knew from SWG &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":97597,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2821"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2821"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2821\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/97597"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2821"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2821"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2821"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
