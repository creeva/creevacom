I did not even attempt it. Instead I thought I would allow myself to give the operating system a day to bake in. I would see how it goes and write-up my impressions.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, my laptop seems to be faster. It also ended with more hard drive space than when the install started. Yes, I did take into account the size of the installer that was deleted. It was only a few gigabytes, but every bit helps.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m bummed out that they removed the RSS reader from within the Mail app. I knew it was coming. Right before the upgrade I backed up all of my personal RSS items. It&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t back up the same information in other formats. I admit this was a complete redundancy strategy. While I&#8217;ll miss this function it has no great effect on my normal work flow.<\/p>\n<p>Being able to right-click images and send them to Flickr is awesome. This is definitely a feature I will be using. It really is only worthwhile if you are a Flickr Pro user, thankfully I already am. I no longer have to open up the browser, navigate to Flickr, and select upload. I know, this one definitely falls into first world problems.<\/p>\n<p>The Twitter integration I probably won&#8217;t use. I would have to change the flow of how I do things to really use it. I rarely use the web interface. I&#8217;m assuming I may use it just a little less than I use the Twitter home page. I did select to update contact photos from Twitter. At least it is going to do that much for me.<\/p>\n<p>The notification center is cool. I did have to download Hiss so my Growl notifications are sent to it. It gives me a simple an obtrusive method to check status of different things. I&#8217;ve used Growl almost as long as I have used OSX. I never managed to delve into the advanced features, but as a desktop notifier it works great. Essentially the notification bar gives me a command center that I can hide or show when I want.<\/p>\n<p>Other than those things, I haven&#8217;t tried out anything in my normal workflow. I have no complaints at all. Definitely worth the 19.99 upgrade cost for the increased speed. Overall, I&#8217;m happy with it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from Wikipedia I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to get a review done in time to cash in on all the link bait craziness yesterday.
