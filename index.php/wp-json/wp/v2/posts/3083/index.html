I had one of those moments and it dealt with climbing walls. I was so convinced it was extraordinary that I thought I had been bitten my a mutant spider. I think it helped that I was into Spider-Man at the time thanks to the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Electric_Company\">Electric Company<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>My super power was being able to climb walls, literally. In the townhouse I grew up in (it was called a condomimium, but I don&#8217;t really think it was a condo) the walls in the stairwell were close enough together that I could shimmy up the walls by putting a set of hands and feet on both sides. My grandmother&#8217;s house was the same way. I&#8217;m sure having a child somewhere between 5-8 years old literally climbing the walls of the house was enough to run my family up the walls themselves.<\/p>\n<p>They spent hours trying to convince me that I wasn&#8217;t related to Spider-Man. I also remember them not being happy about scrubbing footprints off the wall at eye level. Somewhere along this time frame I also managed to get a picture of myself on Spider-Man&#8217;s lap taken at Midway Mall in Elyria. I had that picture for years, but for some reason it&#8217;s now missing :(.<\/p>\n<p>I do remember attempting to fly and levitate for years, but I wasn&#8217;t as successful as I was at being a wall crawler.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here You know those moments when your a kid and you find something that you can do that you think is extraordinary?
