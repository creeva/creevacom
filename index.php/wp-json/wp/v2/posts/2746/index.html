It wastes fuel. It destroys plants that may be beautiful and grow free. It releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As good neighbors, however, we are expected to maintain a level of lawn care. However, with gasoline approaching four dollars a gallon is this still wise? Aren&#8217;t there better things we can do with our time and our money?

I know deep down that most of you don&#8217;t care. However, like everything else I write this is for my venting and I&#8217;m just hoping you enjoy the insight into myself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I know I&#8217;m on a lawn kick (if you didn&#8217;t get it from my last post) but I was thinking today about what a waste it truly is to mow the lawn.
