I&#8217;m easily amused and have the &#8220;Ooooooooooooooooooooohhh Shiny&#8221; mentality type of distraction. I don&#8217;t deny it. I don&#8217;t exactly revel in it either. By the time I actually get around to doing some of the things I need to get done, it&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m tired and cranky. If I put things off until the weekend we end up doing stuff and getting involved (&#8220;Is that a shiny over there?&#8221;) and so things once again get overlooked. I&#8217;m not sure I would actually sleep if I didn&#8217;t know for certainty that it helps save my job and my marriage. So what can I do about it?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/430890004_98639b3bb7_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Picture from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/rickharris\/430890004\/\">here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Things I have tried with little or no success:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wall Calenders<\/li>\n<li>Sticky Notes<\/li>\n<li>Todo Tasks in Outlook<\/li>\n<li>Todo Tasks on Google<\/li>\n<li>GTD sites<\/li>\n<li>Web Calenders<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Nothing so far seems to work for me &#8211; I&#8217;m mundane blind. When there is a shiny I don&#8217;t even notice the mundane.<\/p>\n<p>Like many geeks, corporate types, etc. I live and die by e-mail. This is something I greatly increased in focus when I was a consultant. Now I can handle literally hundreds of e-mails a day, and I can&#8217;t stand a cluttered mail box. I normally use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gmail.com\">Gmail<\/a>&#8216;s interface just through a browser, but I&#8217;ve been known to dabble in POP3 and IMAP access (the insanity!!). Mostly though I just use the web browser. It&#8217;s the same at work, home, and on the go. The one thing I hate most about my mail box, is when it get&#8217;s full. I hate a cluttered inbox, I hate coming back and seeing more then one page of e-mail waiting for me (which does happen if there is some strange reason I don&#8217;t check my email for two days).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/49180453_b28863d1fa_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"240\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Picture from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/marshed\/49180453\/\">here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>So I stumble on the idea of combining these two things, hatred of e-mail clutter and a need to get motivated and GTD, so now I&#8217;m email my tasks to myself (and now <a href=\"http:\/\/xielanthia.com\">Xie<\/a> has joined into the game). The first thing when I went down this road is to send myself a daily list of tasks to do, well I tried that once in the past and that doesn&#8217;t seem to help. Neither do reminder services, since I easily dismiss them.<\/p>\n<p>The format I use when I mail myself is TODO (task) &#8211; this forces me to stare at it every time I look at my e-mail. I&#8217;m hoping it will succesfully burn the task into my brain. When I actually complete the task it get&#8217;s archived, thereby saving me space in my inbox. Too many tasks and it will roll over to a second page, I would be highly annoyed if that happened. So essentially I&#8217;m going to be GTD by annoying myself.<\/p>\n<p>Meh.<\/p>\n<p>But it may work.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here I get distracted when I get home from work.
