I thought it was amazing. \u00a0It was a large fiberglass slide with fifteen racing lanes. \u00a0Looking at the pictures I would guess it was roughly four stories tall (between 40-50 feet). \u00a0It was a complete blast that I loved even as a teenager. \u00a0It was located where Snoopy Land is today.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:Giant_slide.jpg\">from Wikipedia<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The routine was simple. \u00a0In the picture immediately above you can see the kid is holding a burlap sack. \u00a0 He is carrying it over to the red bin at the opposite side (which is identical to the bin the guy in the orange shirt is leaning against on the closed side). \u00a0 When you went to ride it you picked up your burlap sack and entered into the turnstiles.<\/p>\n<p>You would haul this sack up the fifty-ish steps. \u00a0I can tell you as a pre-teen, these could be quite awkward since they had some weight to them. \u00a0 Once you got to the top you were assigned a lane and sat down the sack at the top of the track to get ready. \u00a0 Once the attendant signaled the race was on. \u00a0Your hair was blowing in breeze. \u00a0You were trying to grab the lane sides to push-off on and give you more speed. \u00a0 This was one of the most important races of my young life. \u00a0 You sped to the bottom and figured which spot you came in.<\/p>\n<p>You then would take the sack put it into the red storage\u00a0bin. \u00a0 The important time was deciding if you were going to do it again. \u00a0The line was normally not too bad so some days I would just cycle through doing this around five times. \u00a0I loved it. \u00a0I would probably rank it as one of my top ten favorite Cedar Point attractions of all time.<\/p>\n<p>For younger kids they could ride down on their parents laps. \u00a0 I think I made my parents take turns for a while when I was too young to ride by myself. \u00a0Somewhere in the lost family albums I know there is a picture of my father and I riding it. \u00a0I&#8217;m sad that the picture is gone.<\/p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s not say that things didn&#8217;t happen on the ride. \u00a0There was always the game of let&#8217;s annoy the attendant by going before the official start time. \u00a0Some people would just go by themselves. \u00a0 This could happen a couple of ways. \u00a0The first is that it was intentional and the person couldn&#8217;t contain themselves (or didn&#8217;t care about the attendants rule of order). \u00a0The second was they accidentally started by moving the wrong way. \u00a0This wasn&#8217;t uncommon in younger kids. \u00a0However, you know when it was a couple of friends (yes I did this often enough) &#8211; that is was intentional and they wanted to race and break the rules together.<\/p>\n<p>Finally let&#8217;s not forget about the friction burns this ride would dish out like large candy bars from the rich house on Halloween. \u00a0 If you were a regular attendee of Cedar Point throughout the season &#8211; this ride was the one most likely to give you an injury. \u00a0Didn&#8217;t keep your knees in &#8211; well there is a massive burn on your leg. \u00a0 Tried to speed your slide by pushing off the walls to propel you &#8211; well your hand lingered a fraction too long &#8211; burned hands. \u00a0I don&#8217;t think it was coincidence it was located right next to the first-aid station. \u00a0 I however sucked up my injuries and moved on and never went and got first-aid.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image by 664030 on Flickr \u00a0The Sky Slide was a one of the giant slide attractions that you will still see at county and state fairs across the country. \u00a0 Is it sad that I &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93509,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/92677"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=92677"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/92677\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93509"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=92677"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=92677"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=92677"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
