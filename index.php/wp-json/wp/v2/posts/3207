There is no method for saving e-mails. None, other than copy and paste &#8211; which is a huge pain in the ass. While I do have the first snippet saved in a Gmail notification I would prefer to have the whole message saved and archived.<\/p>\n<p>2. After two weeks it deletes your sent messages &#8211; WTF? Why can&#8217;t I decide to clean out my inbox &#8211; if you want to clean them out why don&#8217;t you give me the option to automatically export a copy out for myself in my home e-mail account?<\/p>\n<p>3. Notifications &#8211; theoretically it wouldn&#8217;t take much more bandwidth to send me the whole message &#8211; I have no problem logging into your site to reply to an email &#8211; but send me the complete email and not the first 140 characters.<\/p>\n<p>I understand e-mail is not a priority for them, and not a focus of the site. I understand they are a walled garden. Dammit though, with the user base some interoperability with their e-mail would be nice.<\/p>\n<p>I hate you Myspace.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now you know if you read my blog regularly that I don&#8217;t have the highest respect for Myspace.
