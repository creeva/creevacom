\u00a0 I read online it was going to be the 28th and that makes a little more sense. \u00a0 Weekends and Friday nights make sense. \u00a0 October 31st makes sense. \u00a0 Thursday October 27th makes no sense.<\/p>\n<p>Lex had his costume and was excited for his first Halloween experience. \u00a0 So we found out he could wear his costume and trick or treat at a place he loves, we jumped on it. \u00a0 Like all families we did attempt to get out of the house earlier in the morning. \u00a0Like most families this didn&#8217;t turn out to be the case. \u00a0 We did rush out fast enough that we had to feed Lex breakfast on the road. \u00a0 We stopped at the Waffle House at the I-71 Delaware exit. \u00a0 While it isn&#8217;t the first Waffle House I&#8217;ve been in, it actually is the first I have eaten at. \u00a0 This one (other than the effect they accept credit cards) seems to be trapped in 1977. \u00a0 The food was ok, but it was a grungy time warped experience. \u00a0 At around 3 we finally made it to the Zoo.<\/p>\n<p>We all got dressed in the car. \u00a0 The reason I mentioned that Lex knew what was in the costume (even though he had only tried it on once) was the belt. \u00a0 At first we thought we forgot the belt. \u00a0 He noticed this immediately. \u00a0After digging we discovered we did have it. \u00a0 Thankfully avoiding the meltdown of Lex noticing the costume was not &#8220;correct&#8221;. \u00a0 This was his\u00a0Shakespearean acting, and nothing was going to be wrong with it.<\/p>\n<p>Just walking in we started to get strange looks. \u00a0There was very few parents that dressed up to take their kids out. \u00a0We purchased our tickets and walked in getting all sorts of looks. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t supposed to rain, but it did for about 15 minutes. \u00a0 Every time we go to the zoo somehow it rains, not matter what the forecast is. \u00a0Thankfully this was short unlike the Noah worthy rain from the last time we went to the Cleveland Zoo. \u00a0 As soon as the rain ended Lex didn&#8217;t want to ride in the stroller. \u00a0 He insisted that Darth Vader walked. \u00a0He received a ton of compliments. \u00a0Some people thought he was dressed as the kid in the Super Bowl commercial. \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately you can&#8217;t make a 2-year-old look too intimidating, even in a Vader mask.<\/p>\n<p>After the first stop to keep the magic alive and add to the persona I started playing the Imperial March on my iPhone and just let loop over and over. \u00a0 Through out the day (according to play count) we heard the song 52 times. \u00a0That means for over 2.5 hours that was pretty much the only music I heard. \u00a0 Lex did however pretty much march in step with the music. \u00a0 It was a long day. \u00a0We kept asking if he wanted to remove the mask, because with the whole thing and the voice changer it was pretty heavy for someone his age. \u00a0 He however insisted on constantly wearing it while walking around. \u00a0He even got upset when he had to remove it to take a drink. \u00a0 We brought the lighter front only Vader mask that we thought he would want to switch to later, it was never worn.<\/p>\n<p>While looking at some of the animals he would remove his helmet. \u00a0At the point he was willing to be picked up to get a better view. \u00a0 Picked up or not, his whole body language changed. \u00a0He no longer was Darth Vader, he was Alexander. \u00a0 Then the mask went on and the process reversed. He is a natural actor that can get into the role. \u00a0We all received compliments (Lex the most) and everyone thought it was great. \u00a0 There were also other Vader&#8217;s there, but none had the full helmet except for Lex. \u00a0 Geek packratting for the win. \u00a0Though he didn&#8217;t get as much candy as he could have traditional trick or treating (we did supplement his candy after the fact), I don&#8217;t think he could have had a better time for Halloween.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-75937\" title=\"Lex Vader\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/Camera-Roll-938_6297265556_o-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/Camera-Roll-938_6297265556_o-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/Camera-Roll-938_6297265556_o-1-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/Camera-Roll-938_6297265556_o-1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/Camera-Roll-938_6297265556_o-1-1070x1427.jpg 1070w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/Camera-Roll-938_6297265556_o-1.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/>\u00a0Lex in his Vader Glory<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lex has been\u00a0obsessed with the Dark Lord of the Sith since the\u00a0Superbowl Commercial\u00a0last year. \u00a0\u00a0We have spent the last year either having to play the Imperial March or hearing Lex sing it pretty much daily &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94388,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/75920"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=75920"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/75920\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94388"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=75920"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=75920"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=75920"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
