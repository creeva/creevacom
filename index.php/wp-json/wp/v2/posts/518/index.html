We&#8217;ll prefix this with the fact that I don&#8217;t usually use any &#8220;hair stay in place&#8221; products. Why did I use it? I&#8217;m not sure. All I can say is I won&#8217;t be doing this again anytime soon &#8211; but I finally answered an age-old question.<\/p>\n<p>In high school I was not the most popular kid in school &#8211; but which blogger or Internet professional was? Maybe the current crowd of kids &#8211; but not the ones that graduated over a decade ago. Man, I&#8217;ll really hate when that becomes two decades. Back on topic. I was accused of having dandruff. I did not have dandruff then nor do I have dandruff now, but I fell prone to one of the greatest follies of the lower caste which was trying to be like them. I used lots of hair gel in school &#8211; Paul Mitchell&#8217;s hair gel to be specific &#8211; and by the end of the day I always had white flakes in my hair. Of course, the flakes were gel and not a scalp issue. I knew this then.<\/p>\n<p>I attempted to use mousse &#8211; which was my hair stay-in-place product of choice for the longest time. I also occasionally used hairspray. While mousse and hairspray generally left fewer flakes at the end of the with the cost being not holding as well as gel &#8211; it was always the same outcome.<\/p>\n<p>Today at the end of the day (I was home 99% of the day running out only to the store) my hair was full of white flakes. The reason is that I have a reactive habit of constantly running my hands through my hair. It is more prevalent when I have long hair (part of the reason I abhor ponytails) but I also do it with my recently shaved head (it does have some hair hence the gel).<\/p>\n<p>Whatever the reason I didn&#8217;t add two and two together all those years ago and this added to my list of reasons why I was further down the social caste chain. So this is more of a rant against my personal use of hair care products, but it needed to be said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So I put hair gel in my hair today.
