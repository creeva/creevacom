I had to manually turn it on so that I receive their updates via IM like I do everyone else I follow. Now the default in the past was to always automatically get device updates when you started following someone (it was this way up until a few days ago). Now I understand the problems they have been having with IM and I assume they also have them with SMS (I don&#8217;t use it). As far as I have seen though there hasn&#8217;t been an official announcement and this is a bit of sneaky behavior.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I applaud them for making the change and do think it&#8217;s beneficial for them, but you would think they would have made some kind of announcement.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I got a message from @ev that he was playing with a new service that gave recommendations on who to follow on Twitter.
