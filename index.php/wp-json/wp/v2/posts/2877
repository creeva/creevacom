or express viewpoints that he would never do in a normal context if he was in control.\u00a0\u00a0 Other friends of his could see him saying that he is going to go off to India to eat a cow or that he just got a job at a college teaching molecular biology.\u00a0\u00a0 Whether he was or wasn&#8217;t isn&#8217;t the fact, other less savvy users may actually believe he is doing\/saying this.<\/p>\n<p>Now the initial knee-jerk reaction is what does it matter it&#8217;s just a stupid game between stupid people.\u00a0\u00a0 Well, let&#8217;s put it from another perspective.\u00a0 Say you purchase Obama and give him a status that is against his own platform, or McCain.\u00a0\u00a0 Say you own Coca-Cola&#8217;s profile and change the status to &#8220;I prefer Pepsi&#8221;.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, this starts to harm the brand image and the reflection on the public that reads this.\u00a0\u00a0 It can cause irreparable harm to the right people with the wrong message.<\/p>\n<p>This is why it really needs to turn into an opt-in environment or at least change to something where you can block your user profile from being used in these sort of application that goes against brand management.\u00a0\u00a0 It needs to be simple and it needs to be able to be done within two clicks.\u00a0\u00a0 It should also default to &#8220;do not use my profile for these applications&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>We can say this is the Web 2.0 world and brand management has changed greatly from where it was just a few years ago.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t believe in companies removing blog posts and I don&#8217;t believe in DMCA takedowns from stories that aren&#8217;t up to the approval of the companies.\u00a0 I do believe I own the lists of my friends, but I don&#8217;t believe I should be able to make changes to their status in any context nor do I believe I should be able to make them perform virtual actions without their consent.<\/p>\n<p>That being said yes I enjoy the game and I&#8217;m going to keep playing, but i think it&#8217;s in a different context.\u00a0 I&#8217;m going to be targetting celebrities and brands in myspace to change the message to something unsuitable (but within Myspace&#8217;s TOS) to help raise awareness on this issue.\u00a0\u00a0 Brand management is very important to companies and yet they have allowed these applications to yank quite a bit of control from them.\u00a0 I can make Pepsi my pet (slave) and have it pimp products for a competitor.\u00a0\u00a0 If it&#8217;s right or wrong is for you to decide, but I&#8217;m sure Pepsi won&#8217;t be too happy about it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from here A few weeks ago I started receiving strange notifications on Myspace stating &#8220;Click Here To See How Much I&#8217;m Worth&#8221;
