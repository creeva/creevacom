This isn&#8217;t about the scenarios where you make elaborate traps to either kill or dissuade your party into following the line you have made. &nbsp;This is solely the fact that you take petty revenge that makes no sense in the mechanics of the game. &nbsp;As long as it isn&#8217;t a constant every time you play with that type of behavior, it doesn&#8217;t make you a bad DM. &nbsp;It does however show that you are having a tantrum because it is a game where people think and follow their desires. &nbsp; You can set up the stage however you like, it doesn&#8217;t mean players will follow.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve played with quite a few DMs in different games. &nbsp; Some were good, some were bad, and some were cruel. &nbsp; I&#8217;m more freeform when I run a game. &nbsp; I have a couple of things that may or may not happen, but I&#8217;m ready to just go off on the fly. &nbsp; The reason I run games this way is that most of the DMs I have played with have taught me that the game is an adversarial process and not a collaborative one.<\/p>\n<p>It becomes a chess match between the player and the person running the game. &nbsp; This has turned into a game where the DM must control the players and the players attempt to do things that the DM doesn&#8217;t want them to. &nbsp; It becomes game theory where the players are working together to win a game that the DM isn&#8217;t quite sure he is playing. &nbsp; They are doing this trying to follow the constraints that the DM has put forth. &nbsp; The DM on the other hand is trying to tell a story in a grand sweeping world, however, what he wants to do is run it like a dungeon crawl. &nbsp;If they wanted a dungeon crawl, they shouldn&#8217;t open up other options.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m doing this in a multi-part post to go over some of the cruelties I have dealt with playing roleplaying games. &nbsp; Maybe you&#8217;ll be inspired to be better, or maybe you&#8217;ll have no ideas to be crueler. &nbsp; To be fair, it really matters what works for your gaming group. &nbsp;Different people need to be handled in different ways. &nbsp; When you start a new group though, you can steer how the game is going to be played in the long run. &nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to steer the direction a different way once things are in motion.<\/p>\n<h2>The Laser From Orbit<\/h2>\n<p>We all have gaming sessions that we remember years and decades later (for those under 20, the decades will come eventually). &nbsp; There is one session that I complain about. &nbsp;It happened around 1996 and we were playing Top Secret SI late into the night.<\/p>\n<p>In the game Top Secret SI you play as a James Bond Spy type. &nbsp;There is a good spy organization and an evil one. &nbsp; We always played as the good guys trying to destroy the evil Web organization. &nbsp; Just like Bond though, quite a few of our missions didn&#8217;t revolve around the opposing organization at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;We had many side missions that went off and just saved the world.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of something like a D20 system or classic Dungeons and Dragons THAC0, Top Secret SI used a percentage system. &nbsp; So if you had a 5% chance of shooting a guy, you better roll a 5 or less on 2 d10s. &nbsp;If you have a 95% chance of doing something, roll a 95 or less. &nbsp; For someone starting out this game is a piece of cake to understand. &nbsp; It was one of the first RPGs I mastered. &nbsp; It seemed so much easier than Rifts which I had played a few times before. &nbsp;We had regular gaming sessions and the storylines were enjoyable.<\/p>\n<p>One day after the main mission had been taken off a co-conspirator and I decided we were going to do a get-rich-quick scheme in the game. &nbsp;While we were always looking for an angle, there was something in the mission that triggered this. &nbsp;I wish I could remember what the original mission was.<\/p>\n<p>We were on our side of the table sketching out a scheme that basically was a Salami Attack. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t know it had a term back then, but a Salami Attack is where you take pennies or fractions of pennies from thousands or millions of accounts. &nbsp; The goal is that these small amounts will go unnoticed and be considered rounding errors. &nbsp; The account that receives this money will have an aggregate amount that leads up to a large mass. &nbsp;While I may have read something similar before I did this, when I worked it out, it was a textbook example of the attack.<\/p>\n<p>When we did our write-up to explain to the DM we took the rounding error method in the electric company&#8217;s billing practices. &nbsp; At the end of the day, it would take any percentage of a penny ($0.009999999 or less) and put those fractions into an account. &nbsp;The plan was to have this as a reoccurring program that would run for a few months and trust fill up the bank account. &nbsp;I would say my co-conspirator and I laid all this out in about 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>The DM was going to make us roll for it. &nbsp; This was fine since my character had been built with very high computer skills. &nbsp; However, during each stage of the plan, the DM required us to roll the dice. &nbsp; I think we went through at least 20 rolls on this. &nbsp;The DM was really hoping that I would fail at some step just so he could put an end to this nonsense. &nbsp;Unfortunately for him, I aced every single one of the rolls. &nbsp;The plan kept progressing.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, of course, we still do not trust the DM. &nbsp; To make sure we crossed the T&#8217;s and dotted the I&#8217;s our characters went through and double-checked everything. &nbsp; This in turn caused us to go through all the rolls again. &nbsp;We had written this process up as a very tight process that the DM didn&#8217;t have much wiggle room. &nbsp; He had agreed it was solid and should work if my dice rolls were successful before we started this whole evening of skill checks.<\/p>\n<p>The process was laid out, the program was written, and there was only one thing left to do &#8211; run the program. &nbsp; I announced that I was starting the program and hitting enter. &nbsp; Then a satellite in orbit above the earth shot down a laser. &nbsp;This blew up the warehouse where my co-conspirator and I had been.<\/p>\n<p>The DM used this point to explain to us that we weren&#8217;t away from the detection capabilities of the US government and we triggered an automatic defense mechanism. &nbsp;This is what caused us to blow up. &nbsp;Being in the IT field, I knew we didn&#8217;t have these capabilities. &nbsp; When I worked at NASA a decade later we didn&#8217;t have any sort of laser defense as an auxiliary attack if our IT infrastructure was compromised. &nbsp; It was just him going along and wasting hours of everyone&#8217;s time to use his hand of god to show you can&#8217;t win.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Was This Cruel?<\/h2>\n<p>We can use this as an example of how to make your players follow the path. &nbsp;However, there were much better ways to handle the scenario. &nbsp;The internet could have gone out, bad guys could have set up a drug meeting in the building we were attempting this from, the fact that it ran successfully for a week and then was discovered. &nbsp;If we had netted a small amount from it, that would be fine and fair for the amount of work we put into it.<\/p>\n<p>The DM just wanted to apply his superiority to the situation. &nbsp; Money was meaningless in the game. My character was a millionaire through family money. &nbsp;I think most of the other players were rich over time. &nbsp; Our organization would give us whatever we needed, so money wasn&#8217;t an obstacle the DM was using within the game anyways. &nbsp;If it had been, this would be a different issue. &nbsp;Money was really meaningless.<\/p>\n<p>Since there would be no tangible gain for the characters that would adjust the plot. &nbsp; That is what makes this cruel. &nbsp; It could have been this interesting side evening game where the DM made all these logic traps to stop us and we rolled the checks to get by, but instead of a mental dungeon crawl &#8211; it was just wasting time. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why it is cruel.<\/p>\n<p>Next time I do one of these articles, I&#8217;m going to talk about how a DM killed everyone because they had prior real life commitments.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About DM Cruelty There are times when you can just be cruel as a DM. &nbsp; This isn&#8217;t about the scenarios where you make elaborate traps to either kill or dissuade your party into following &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95399,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95398"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95398"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95398\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":103436,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95398\/revisions\/103436"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95399"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95398"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95398"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95398"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
