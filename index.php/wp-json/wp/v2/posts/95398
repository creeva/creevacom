can just be cruel as a DM. \u00a0 This isn&#8217;t about the scenarios where you make elaborate traps to either kill or dissuade your party into following the line you have made. \u00a0This is solely the fact that you take petty revenge that makes no sense into the mechanics of the game. \u00a0As long as it isn&#8217;t a constant every time you play type of behavior, it doesn&#8217;t make you a bad DM. \u00a0It does however show that you are having a tantrum because it is a game where people think and follow their desires. \u00a0 You can set up the stage however you like, it doesn&#8217;t mean player&#8217;s will follow.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve played with quite a few DMs in different games. \u00a0 Some where good, some were bad, and some were cruel. \u00a0 I&#8217;m more free form when I run a game. \u00a0 I have a couple of things that may or may not happen, but I&#8217;m ready to just go off on the fly. \u00a0 The reason I run games this way is that most the DMs I have played with have taught me that the game is an adversarial process and not a collaborative one.<\/p>\n<p>It becomes a chess match between the player and the person running the game. \u00a0 This has turned into a game where the DM must control the players and the players attempt to do things that the DM doesn&#8217;t want them to. \u00a0 It becomes game theory where the players are working together to win a game that the DM isn&#8217;t quite sure he is playing. \u00a0 They are doing this trying to follow the constraints that the DM has put forth. \u00a0 The DM on the other hand is trying to tell a story in a grand sweeping world, however what he wants to is run it like a dungeon crawl. \u00a0If they wanted a dungeon crawl, they shouldn&#8217;t open up other options.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m doing this in a multi-part post to go over some of the cruelties I have dealt with playing roleplaying games. \u00a0 Maybe you&#8217;ll be inspired to be better, maybe you&#8217;ll have no ideas to be more cruel. \u00a0 To be fair, it really matters on what works for your gaming group. \u00a0Different people need to be handled in different ways. \u00a0 When you start a new group though, you can steer how the game is going to be played in the long run. \u00a0 It&#8217;s hard to steer the direction a different way once things are in motion.<\/p>\n<h2>The Laser From Orbit<\/h2>\n<p>We all have gaming sessions that we remember years and decades later (for those under 20, the decades will come eventually). \u00a0 There is one session that I complain about. \u00a0It happened around 1996 and we were playing Top Secret SI late into the night.<\/p>\n<p>In the game Top Secret SI you play as James Bond Spy type. \u00a0There is a good spy organization and an evil one. \u00a0 We always played as the good guys trying to destroy the evil Web organization. \u00a0 Just like Bond though, quite a few of our missions didn&#8217;t revolve around the opposing organization at all. \u00a0\u00a0We had many side missions that went off and just saved the world.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of something like a D20 system or classic Dungeons and Dragons THAC0, Top Secret SI used a percentage system. \u00a0 So if you had a 5% chance to shooting a guy, you better roll a 5 or less on 2 d10&#8217;s. \u00a0If you have a 95% chance of doing something, roll a 95 or less. \u00a0 For someone starting out this game is a piece of cake to understand. \u00a0 It was one of the first RPGs I mastered. \u00a0 It seemed so much easier than Rifts which I had played a few times before. \u00a0We had regular gaming sessions and the storylines were enjoyable.<\/p>\n<p>One day after the main mission had been taken of a co-conspirator and I decided we were going to do a get rich quick scheme in the game. \u00a0While we were always looking for an angle, there was something in the mission that had triggered this. \u00a0I wish I could remember what the original mission was.<\/p>\n<p>We were on our side of the table sketching out a scheme that basically was a Salami Attack. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t know it had a term back then, but a Salami Attack is where you take pennies or fractions of pennies from thousands or millions of accounts. \u00a0 The goal is that these small amount will go unnoticed and be considered rounding errors. \u00a0 The account that receives this money will have an aggregate amount that leads up to a large mass. \u00a0While I may have read something similar before I did this, when I worked it out, it was a textbook example of the attack.<\/p>\n<p>When we doing our write-up to explain to the DM we took the rounding error method in the electric companies billing practices. \u00a0 At the end of the day it would take any percentage of a penny ($0.009999999 or less) and put those fractions into an account. \u00a0The plan was to have this as a reoccurring program that would run for a few months and trust fill up the bank account. \u00a0I would say my co-conspirator and I laid all this out in about 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>The DM was going to make us roll for it. \u00a0 This was fine since my character had been built with very high computer skills. \u00a0 However, during each stage of the plan the DM required us to roll the dice. \u00a0 I think we went through at least 20 rolls on this. \u00a0The DM was really hoping that I would fail at some step just so he could put an end to this nonsense. \u00a0Unfortunately for him, I aced every single one of the rolls. \u00a0The plan kept progressing.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, of course we still do not trust the DM. \u00a0 To make sure we crossed the T&#8217;s and dotted the I&#8217;s our characters went through and double checked everything. \u00a0 This in turn caused us to go through all the\u00a0rolls again. \u00a0We had written this process up as a very tight process that the DM didn&#8217;t have much wiggle room. \u00a0 He had agreed it was solid and should work if my dice rolls were\u00a0successful before we started this whole evening of skill checks.<\/p>\n<p>The process was laid out, the program was written, there was only one thing left to do &#8211; run the program. \u00a0 I announced that I was starting the program and hitting enter. \u00a0 Then a satellite in orbit above the earth shot down a laser. \u00a0This blew up the warehouse where my co-conspirator and I had \u00a0been.<\/p>\n<p>The DM used this point to explain to us that we weren&#8217;t away the detection capabilities of the US government and we triggered an automatic defense mechanism. \u00a0This is what caused us to blow up. \u00a0Being in the IT field, I knew we didn&#8217;t have these capabilities. \u00a0 When I worked at NASA a decade later we didn&#8217;t have any sort of laser defense as an auxiliary attack if our IT infrastructure was compromised. \u00a0 It was just him going along and wasting hours of everyone&#8217;s time to use his hand of god to show you can&#8217;t win.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Was This Cruel?<\/h2>\n<p>We can use this as an example of how to make your players follow the path. \u00a0However, there were much better ways to handle the scenario. \u00a0The internet could have gone out, bad guys could have set up a drug meeting in the building we were attempting this from, the fact that it ran successfully for a week and then was discovered. \u00a0If we had netted a small amount from it, that would be fine and fair for the amount of work we put into it.<\/p>\n<p>The DM just wanted to apply his superiority to the situation. \u00a0 Money was meaningless in the game. My character was a millionaire through family money. \u00a0I think most the other player&#8217;s were rich from over time. \u00a0 Our organization would give us whatever we needed, so money wasn&#8217;t an obstacle the DM was using within the game anyways. \u00a0If it had been, this would be a different issue. \u00a0Money was really meaningless.<\/p>\n<p>Since there would be no tangible gain for the characters that would adjust the plot. \u00a0 That is what makes this cruel. \u00a0 It could have been this interesting side evening game where the DM made all these logic traps to stop us and we rolled the checks to get by, but instead of a mental dungeon crawl &#8211; it was just wasting time. \u00a0That&#8217;s why it is cruel.<\/p>\n<p>Next time I do one of these articles, I&#8217;m going to talk about how a DM killed everyone because they had prior real life commitments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This post of originally written for Duesr.com About DM Cruelty There are times when you can just be cruel as a DM. \u00a0 This isn&#8217;t about the scenarios where you make elaborate traps to either &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95399,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95398"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95398"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95398\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95399"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95398"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95398"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95398"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
