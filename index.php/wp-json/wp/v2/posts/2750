one of the family.\u00a0\u00a0 From my perspective, especially now, I can say that she was probably one of the most normal one in the family.\u00a0\u00a0 She was also one of the ones most like me.\u00a0\u00a0 She had a voracious appetite for reading and absorbing knowledge.\u00a0 She didn&#8217;t also believe in popular opinion and would find things in her own way.\u00a0\u00a0 I think part of her problem was she was born in the wrong era.\u00a0 I think she would have been absorbed and delighted with the Internet and the way things are today.<\/p>\n<p>The dream mostly consisted of a normal visit where she was staying with my grandparents.\u00a0\u00a0 There was just normal talking and I was my current age for whatever reason.\u00a0 There was nothing contextually strange or out of place and no significant incidents occurred.\u00a0 When she did leave I was crying and my grandparents were questioning why I was upset.\u00a0\u00a0 I was going on how she had gotten her doctorate (she hadn&#8217;t IRL) and how she was a great woman.\u00a0\u00a0 How her views and ideas mattered.\u00a0\u00a0 In the dream, I had almost worked myself up to a frenzy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then I woke up.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I noticed when I woke up was my face was soaked and covered in tears.\u00a0\u00a0 This was one of those dreams that bled over from the dream world to the real world.\u00a0\u00a0 I can say I truly miss her, but I don&#8217;t think of her that often, and definitely not as often as I should. \u00a0 I have a few pictures of her and they stand around being a testament to where I&#8217;ve come from. \u00a0 My grandmother used to save up books and give them to me. \u00a0 I still have quite a few of those books she has given me over the years.\u00a0 She was a strong lady and I think that life moves on in a strange way.<\/p>\n<p>Why am I writing this?\u00a0 I think I just want a testament to knowing that I&#8217;m still not in a dream.\u00a0 That this is what is real.\u00a0\u00a0 Grief is a hard thing to deal with and sometimes it hits you at the strangest of times.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last night was strange.\u00a0\u00a0 The first part is strange is that I actually had a dream that I can remember.\u00a0 From my normal perspective, I dream next to never.\u00a0 I&#8217;m aware of the human dream &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":97591,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2750"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2750"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2750\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/97591"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2750"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2750"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2750"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
