or just wanted the easiest outfit available.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We are going to skip ahead a few years for the pictures. \u00a0 Some interim pictures that are missing. \u00a0 At two years old I was Raggedy Andy. \u00a0A few years later my mother sewed me up a pretty fine Raccoon Costume. \u00a0I had a couple of those plastic mask vinyl sheet costumes. \u00a0 I think I was Luke Skywalker one year and C3PO another. \u00a0 I was also a vampire at some part of my Halloween career. \u00a0 That is all I can remember from the missing images.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94632\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/odcs-1-300x289.jpg\" alt=\"odcs\" width=\"300\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/odcs-1-300x289.jpg 300w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/odcs-1.jpg 654w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I actually think this was for a Thanksgiving Feast at Open Door. \u00a0 \u00a0Abraham Lincoln marching right around with Pilgrims, cowboys and indians. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t know if it was assigned or just a Bill and Tedesque visitation by Lincoln to this earlier time. \u00a0 At first I was thinking that Open Door didn&#8217;t have a Halloween celebration (being a Christian School celebrating a Pagan holiday), but they did. \u00a0When we dressed up in a costume there was a big parade through the school. \u00a0The thought was everyone could then see everyone else&#8217;s costumes. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t remember if it was the youngest class or oldest class that went first in the parade. \u00a0 The class would start and then parade through the next class, at the tail end of the parade that classroom joined the parade. \u00a0This continued on until all classrooms were in the parade.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While I was at Open Door I had a Halloween party every year between 2nd and 4th grade. \u00a0 I would invite the boys from my class and we would have candy, pizza, and treats at my house. \u00a0 Afterwards my father would pile us all in the car and we would go through a haunted house. \u00a0 We didn&#8217;t experience the haunted house since our faces were all buried in my dads jacket. \u00a0It was like he was the sun and we were all in fixated orbit around him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94623\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/billyj-1-206x300.jpg\" alt=\"billyj\" width=\"206\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/billyj-1-206x300.jpg 206w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/billyj-1.jpg 415w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94645\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/3249683052_809794fc6d_b-1-221x300.jpg\" alt=\"3249683052_809794fc6d_b\" width=\"221\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/3249683052_809794fc6d_b-1-221x300.jpg 221w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/3249683052_809794fc6d_b-1.jpg 755w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 221px) 100vw, 221px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This was the first year I was lazy. \u00a0 I think it started because I had decided I was too old to go trick or treating. \u00a0 I was then told I would have to walk with my brother anyways. \u00a0 If I had to babysit, I sure was going to make a half-ass attempt to get candy. \u00a0Seeing it was last-minute I didn&#8217;t have time to put together a great costume. \u00a0 This was my attempt at Billy Joel. \u00a0 We start with Billy Joel getting stabbed by Jason Voorhees. \u00a0 Then Jason and Billy are posing with a Ballerina and a Beauty Contestant. \u00a0It all makes perfect sense.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is a couple of years later. \u00a0I still had not given up the candy hall. \u00a0 I can tell you two things definitively about this costume and time period. \u00a0I am wearing a suit, that means I was in high school. \u00a0 In high school I had a couple of suits &#8211; today I have none (just laziness). \u00a0 Secondly those are marching band gloves on my hands. \u00a0 This puts this picture at my Sophomore or Junior Year at the most likely\u00a0time.

It was a fantastic scene, yet I knew how close I came to breaking my neck. \u00a0 I was never doing that stunt again. \u00a0 They did ask for other volunteers, but no one else was willing. \u00a0I continued to work the Graveyard scene that season, but as a jumper. \u00a0After this season unless I did it for a particular costume or whim for a week, I would have my goatee until this day.<\/p>\n<p

\u00a0 Which is funny since I&#8217;m next to holy man. \u00a0I wore the kilt to a couple of Marcons. \u00a0 I went as Neo one year, and another year I purchased the parts that would become my Vlad

from the School House&#8217;s Photojournal shoot my second year (1997). \u00a0 At this point I&#8217;m doing my makeup and outfits. \u00a0 Normally I worked the greeting ramp and acted as a guide.

pieces I&#8217;m missing from this costume almost two decades later is the belt and the dagger. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t have the same pants, but they were rotating between different dark pants. \u00a0

hat is still in good condition. \u00a0 By my final year that hat was beat to hell. \u00a0 Today it&#8217;s half crumbled (purposely so). \u00a0I had decided by the end of 2000 that I was done. \u00a0 I was retiring. \u00a0I would come and hang out, but my in makeup days were over for working at the School House. \u00a0I was told I wouldn&#8217;t be able to stay away, but the following day I was offered a job that moved me to the opposite side of the country to Oregon. \u00a0 Vlad was retired from the School House for all time.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A group of us went to a haunted house in Oregon, the decorations and scenes were fantastic. \u00a0 The actors however, they fell flat. \u00a0 Two of us decided we wanted to play in the house. \u00a0 \u00a0We talked to the organizers and they said we could come back the next night. \u00a0 We were definitely more into it than the rest of them, and gave tips on how to work the scenes to their volunteers. \u00a0 We went full costume and this is the last time I went full Vlad.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94629\"
