I want to love Gcal. I really truly and deeply do. I do love it more then <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Microsoft_outlook\">Microsoft Outlook<\/a>&#8216;s Calendar, but that is still an issue since it doesn&#8217;t have complete integration with <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Microsoft_Exchange_Server\">Microsoft Exchange<\/a>. I have however recently configure my Outlook calendar to sync with Gcal with a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/support\/calendar\/bin\/answer.py?answer=89955\" class=\"broken_link\">nifty tool Google released<\/a>. For that I bless them. No more hacks or work arounds, or siphoning data through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.plaxo.com\" class=\"broken_link\">Plaxo<\/a> to get this going. I still use Plaxo, but I don&#8217;t need a desktop client for it anymore, it replicates the back end internet data now.<\/p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;ve said everything (well not really but I spoke nice about them) that I like about Gcal. Let&#8217;s look at some of the things I want. The first thing that I have always wanted was the ability to import RSS feeds into to Gcal. I&#8217;m not talking news feeds that I want to read, but personal <a href=\"http:\/\/www.readwriteweb.com\/archives\/lifestreaming_primer.ph\" class=\"broken_link\">lifestreaming<\/a> data that I can track about myself. I should be able to use Google Calendar as a personal diary of events, but this leads to a lot of back tracking because of the manual work this would cause.<\/p>\n<p>Another option that would allow me to deal with the fact that I can not import RSS feeds would be allow us to send in events via E-mail. You allows us to send in events via SMS (which I don&#8217;t use since i don&#8217;t pay for an SMS plan) &#8211; yet not e-mail? It&#8217;s not really a bandwidth thing since most of your users are probably using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gmail.com\">Gmail<\/a> anyways. I don&#8217;t get it.<\/p>\n<p>Final thing I would like, the ability to attach a file (which in reality could be stored in <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.google.com\">Google Docs<\/a>) to an event. Whether it would be a picture (ok this would be <a href=\"http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/\">Picasaweb<\/a> for storage) or a presentation, this would lead to a more organized life for business users making a transition.<\/p>\n<p>Give us some killer apps, you have us as users, now keep us. Show us some love.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here Previously I railed against Google Docs and my issues with them there, now it&#8217;s the Google Calendar&#8216;s Team that I&#8217;m having issues with.
