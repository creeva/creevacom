I disagree. \u00a0I think everyone is entitled to these services. \u00a0 To get entry everyone must pay an equal share.<\/p>\n<p>The upper and middle should share the <strong>same percentage<\/strong> of the lower class \u00a0to get any and all government services. \u00a0 If the services can not be provided for levels of class (<em>regardless if they are used<\/em>) at a level the government could afford, then the program should be cut, re-evaluated, and trimmed for waste. \u00a0 I have worked for the government, there is plenty of waste.<\/p>\n<p>One of the issues is healthcare insurance. \u00a0 Insurance isn&#8217;t cheap. \u00a0I may sit somewhere in the middle class, but I do pay almost 5,000 a year for insurance. \u00a0My employer shoulders the other side of that, to what I assume is an almost equal amount. \u00a0 I would happily pay that money over to fund national healthcare at the same level I currently receive it. \u00a0 Then people would complain it was a tax, even if it was equal. \u00a0 The money spent by the individual might be the same, but since it is a tax they are against it.<\/p>\n<p>For another side, my employer originally didn&#8217;t have healthcare. \u00a0 We went without it. \u00a0 Individually carried healthcare was\u00a0quoted\u00a0to us as being around 1300 a month, roughly 15k a year. \u00a0We risked going without it. \u00a0 Thankfully nothing major happened that we would have needed it. \u00a0 Everyone that has jobs and corporate sponsored healthcare isn&#8217;t aware of the cost when you go it alone. \u00a0 If a company can lower rate by at least 30% &#8211; what can a nation do?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m getting a little sidetracked here. \u00a0This argument is on equality in expense, not healthcare reform. \u00a0It was just one of the points (<em>under Medicare and Medicaid<\/em>) along with infrastructure and education that was in the video.<\/p>\n<h2>Top Tax Rate Is at an Historic Low<\/h2>\n<p>This is a good thing. \u00a0I don&#8217;t care what anyone thinks, this is a good thing. \u00a0 Any person can take benefit from tax loopholes. \u00a0 The more money you make allows you to take advantage of more loopholes, but that is the nature of the beast. \u00a0 Fight for tax reform in the form of closing the loopholes. \u00a0The goal is to not raise taxes, but to get everyone on a level playing field. \u00a0People making ten thousand a year should pay the same percentage as someone making ten million.<\/p>\n<h2>The Can Afford It<\/h2>\n<p>This is the dumbest argument in the piece. \u00a0 Just because someone can afford something doesn&#8217;t mean they have to give their money away. \u00a0Either through their job, their talent, or family &#8211; someone earned that money. \u00a0It is not someone else&#8217;s right to expect any part of it.<\/p>\n<p>The video points out that the middle class is the real wealth makers in America. \u00a0 I agree with that. \u00a0Some of the middle class also is capable of breaking free and make it to the upper class. \u00a0 It&#8217;s the nature of the beast. \u00a0 It&#8217;s not easy, but it happens.<\/p>\n<p>The rich get richer just because of interest earned on what they have. \u00a0 They may make it through other reasons, but Mark Zuckerberg makes more in a week on the interest to his funds than most the lower class make a year. \u00a0 That doesn&#8217;t mean he has to share it at a higher percentage rate than the lower class.<\/p>\n<p>In the video they said it is not class warfare, but anything that does not push a tax equality on everyone is speaking in class warfare. \u00a0 My wife and I have discussed this over the years and have a pretty standard consensus on the matter. We believe in a flat 30% &#8211; 40% sales tax to be levied on everything except food. \u00a0 Rich people buy expensive things. \u00a0Poor people buy less expensive things. \u00a0Everyone could consider their purchases and decide if they really want the next shiny toy. \u00a0 Food tax-free allows the lower class to feed their families without a tax burden.<\/p>\n<p>A flat sales tax in theory should be able to cover the inequality in wealth. \u00a0 With a system like this in place we should be able to negate an income tax system. \u00a0 To move into it (and teach americans not to necessarily hoard money) we could have a flat income tax of 15% with a 15-25% sales tax. \u00a0In the end though, I believe in a flat system where everyone regardless of class pays the same rate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Earlier today a friend sent me a video titled &#8220;Why You and I Have to Cover What The Rich Don&#8217;t Pay&#8220;. \u00a0 She asked my opinion on it. \u00a0 Normally I agree with her &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93356,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93355"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93355"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93355\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93356"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93355"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93355"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93355"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
