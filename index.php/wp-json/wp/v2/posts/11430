I guess the true outcome will be looking at the generation that comes after us.\u00a0 How will they turn out?\u00a0\u00a0 Will they become more &#8220;mature&#8221; in what we viewed as children that traditional &#8220;grown-ups&#8221; would be?\u00a0\u00a0 Will they rush to be old and give up the childhood and teenage years that my generation seems to cling to?\u00a0\u00a0 Maybe that they named us Gen X because they didn&#8217;t know what was going to happen with us is still occurring.\u00a0\u00a0 We still break the mold in a way that just doesn&#8217;t fit the same way in society.\u00a0\u00a0 Curious and odd, you would think after three decades we would have an idea of what we are by now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Before anyone thinks that this might be about anyone in particular, it is just as much about myself as it is anyone else.\u00a0 I&#8217;m in my mid-thirties, and from what I remember of my parents &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11430"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=11430"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/11430\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=11430"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=11430"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=11430"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
