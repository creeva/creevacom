I&#8217;ve taught training classes. I&#8217;ve given pitches and reporting data to CIOs of Fortune 500 companies. I&#8217;ve given a couple of public presentations at a convention. I&#8217;ve done this before and I&#8217;ll do it again. That doesn&#8217;t make it any easier. We&#8217;ve moved up from being high school students that used note cards, now we&#8217;re adults that use PowerPoint presentations. Essentially it is the same thing, but now everyone else can see your note cards. Since everyone else can see them don&#8217;t be a complete putz and read them verbatim.<\/p>\n<p>I can say at the beginning of one training class I did read the slides verbatim, but I told the class I was going to and that I was forced to show them the slide show. After the idiotic powerpoint presentation I taught them properly.<\/p>\n<p>Why then am I scared or nervous?<\/p>\n<p>I think it deals with scope. The smaller the audience the easier I handle it, I can control the crowd and the conversation. Handling things coming from 6-7 people at once is my specialty. On the other hand, large-scale presentations when you are passing the 20-people mark, that&#8217;s my weakness. It really is no different and I don&#8217;t know why I have a problem with it. It&#8217;s a demon I wrestle with. For the most part, I prefer to be the problem-solving, the implementation guy, the brains. I don&#8217;t like being the presenter or the frontman.<\/p>\n<p>So this is what I&#8217;m facing tomorrow. Wish me luck.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now I&#8217;m not going to say that I&#8217;m incapable of giving presentations, I&#8217;ve given my share.
