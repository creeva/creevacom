I do hope they have an option of using a cracked and a uncracked helmet. \u00a0 For nostalgia&#8217;s sake&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">One of my friend&#8217;s posted on Facebook that he smelled a sequel. \u00a0 Over a week ago it was already announced that a sequel was in the works. \u00a0 It was a great fun movie. \u00a0 It felt like a proper Lego experience. \u00a0 Finally, while everything is awesome &#8211; that song did not repeat throughout the movie as many times as I feared it would. \u00a0 There is one time it plays straight through, a couple of call backs in the background, and a couple more small excerpts. \u00a0 If you worried about it, I wouldn&#8217;t be. \u00a0On the other hand I think it has a chance of being this year&#8217;s &#8220;Call Me Maybe&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
