This was a very interesting experience in the sense that it is two worlds that were vastly different finally meeting. I&#8217;ve played SWG since June 2003, but yet in all my travels had not managed to meet up with anyone that has played the game. Luckily the first person I did get to meet is one of my oldest and dearest true virtual friends. I&#8217;m hoping to head back out to LA in a couple of weeks and we can do it again.<\/p>\n<p>This week I&#8217;m in NYC, and I managed to do my obligatory trek to the Hard Rock Cafe (I&#8217;m in the frequent buyer&#8217;s program so I eat there exclusively when there is one close by). I checked the Times Square Toys R&#8217; US to see if they had any Wii&#8217;s since that was the primary North American launch site &#8211; no joy. I&#8217;ve now seen the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree lit up in December so that&#8217;s another thing I can cross off my list.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that irked me last night however is that I managed to get back to my hotel and I stop by the gift shop to pick up 3 20 oz Coke bottles. When I went to the check out I also picked up a lighter (marked 0.38) &#8211; the total came to 14.64 &#8211; they don&#8217;t take credit cards. I didn&#8217;t get the normal &#8211; our credit card machine is down- I got a flat we don&#8217;t take credit cards &#8211; how asinine is that?<\/p>\n<p>I have an article I was going to write in response to my question about how to migrate and back up your RSS feeds &#8211; hopefully I can get to that tonight when I get off-site.<\/p>\n<p>TTFN<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last week I was in LA doing some work for a client &#8211; I managed to meet a friend IRL that I had only known virtually through SWG.
