I&#8217;ll get back to that subject as soon as I get a chance. Let&#8217;s move onto monitoring your crossposting.<\/p>\n<p>Some people may have noticed that on <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/life-stream\/\" class=\"broken_link\">my lifestream<\/a> there seem to be duplicate posts. This is because I&#8217;ve been working on adding all the RSS feeds from all the services in one trackable lifestream. The benefits are that you can see and track how long information takes to get from one site to the next. This also allows you to see where your crossposting is failing. For example I&#8217;m noticing that my posts going to <a href=\"http:\/\/pownce.com\/creeva\" class=\"broken_link\">pownce<\/a> are not getting through so when I get a chance I&#8217;ll look into what is actually causing that.<\/p>\n<p>Lifestreaming all of our sites into one endpoint site that you can control and maintain allows all the little maintance to happy at a single glance. We all know that crossposting is usually best effort delivery. Not everything shows up in all the sites, but that happens because your not actively maintaining those sites and sometimes things just go wrong.<\/p>\n<p>By having a single stream of all of your sites you are not bogged looking at RSS items for every site all together. If I put all my feed items in <a href=\"http:\/\/reader.google.com\" class=\"broken_link\">google reader<\/a> then it would take me an hour each day to get through all of them. Having a quick glance allows the information to be singled out in a daily quick view.<\/p>\n<p>Currently I&#8217;m using the <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\">wordpress<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.davidcramer.net\/my-projects\/lifestream\" class=\"broken_link\">lifestream plugin<\/a> to handle my lifestream page. It gives me the benefit of having a daily summary post generated automatically. This allows me to have a permanent archive of all of <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/category\/lifestream-archive\/\" class=\"broken_link\">my daily archives<\/a> that I can go back search and vault away in my own life vaulting fashion.<\/p>\n<p>Life is good. Maintaining and monitoring in a single glance &#8211; that&#8217;s great.<\/p>\n<p>Previous Entries in The <a class=\"st_tag internal_tag broken_link\" title=\"Posts tagged with Crossposting\" rel=\"tag nofollow\" href=\"..\/2008\/06\/10\/2008\/05\/27\/2008\/05\/22\/tag\/crossposting\/\">Crossposting<\/a> God Series:<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Article-Link (Permalink)\" rel=\"bookmark\" href=\"..\/2008\/06\/10\/2008\/05\/27\/2008\/05\/22\/2008\/05\/21\/2008\/05\/21\/the-crossposting-god-series-part-1-the-introduction\/\">The Crossposting God Series Part 1 &#8211; The Introduction<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"..\/2008\/06\/10\/2008\/05\/27\/2008\/05\/21\/the-crossposting-god-series-part-2-vox\/\">The Crossposting God Series Part 2 &#8211; Vox<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Article-Link (Permalink)\" rel=\"bookmark\" href=\"..\/2008\/06\/10\/2008\/05\/27\/2008\/05\/22\/2008\/05\/22\/crosspost-livejournal\/\">The Crossposting God Series Part 3 &#8211; Live Journal and Derivative Sites<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Article-Link (Permalink)\" rel=\"bookmark\" href=\"..\/2008\/06\/10\/2008\/05\/27\/2008\/05\/22\/distribution-and-endpoints\/\">The Crossposting God Series Part 4 &#8211; Entry, Distribution, and End Points<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Article-Link (Permalink)\" rel=\"bookmark\" href=\"..\/2008\/06\/10\/2008\/05\/27\/the-crossposting-god-series-part-5-myspace\/\">The Crossposting God Series Part 5 &#8211; Myspace<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"..\/2008\/06\/09\/rss-crosspost\/\">The Crossposting God Series Part 6 &#8211; RSS Feeds to Crosspost<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"..\/2008\/06\/09\/rss-crosspost\/\"><\/a><a title=\"Permanent Link: The Crossposting God Series Part 7 - Where Can You Post By E-Mail?\" rel=\"bookmark\" href=\"..\/2008\/06\/10\/the-crossposting-god-series-part-7-where-can-you-post-by-e-mail\/\">The Crossposting God Series Part 7 &#8211; Where Can You Post By E-Mail?<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here In part 8 I was going to write about crossposting to blogger, but that&#8217;s been delayed for the time being.
