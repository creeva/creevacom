I&#8217;ll get back to that subject as soon as I get a chance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&#8217;s move on to monitoring your cross-posting.<\/p>\n<p>Some people may have noticed that on my lifestream there seem to be duplicate posts.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is because I&#8217;ve been working on adding all the RSS feeds from all the services in one trackable lifestream.&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits are that you can see and track how long information takes to get from one site to the next.&nbsp;&nbsp; This also allows you to see where your crossposting is failing.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, I&#8217;m noticing that my posts going to Pownce are not getting through so when I get a chance I&#8217;ll look into what is actually causing that.<\/p>\n<p>Lifestreaming all of our sites into one endpoint site that you can control and maintain allows all the little maintenance to happy at a single glance.&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know that crossposting is usually best-effort delivery.&nbsp; Not everything shows up on all the sites, but that happens because your not actively maintaining those sites, and sometimes things just go wrong.<\/p>\n<p>By having a single stream of all of your sites you are not bogged down looking at RSS items for every site together.&nbsp; If I put all my feed items in google reader then it would take me an hour each day to get through all of them.&nbsp; Having a quick glance allows the information to be singled out in a daily quick view.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m using the WordPress lifestream plugin to handle my lifestream page.&nbsp; It gives me the benefit of having a daily summary post generated automatically.&nbsp; This allows me to have a permanent archive of all of my daily archives that I can go back search and vault away in my own life-vaulting fashion.<\/p>\n<p>Life is good.&nbsp; Maintaining and monitoring in a single glance &#8211; that&#8217;s great.<\/p>\n<p>Previous Entries in The Crossposting God Series:<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Article-Link (Permalink)\" href=\"..\/2008\/06\/10\/2008\/05\/27\/2008\/05\/22\/2008\/05\/21\/2008\/05\/21\/the-crossposting-god-series-part-1-the-introduction\/\" rel=\"bookmark\">The Crossposting God Series Part 1 &#8211;
