I could then make a blog post of the irrational behavior of both sides of this recent Huckleberry Finn debate. I downloaded the <a href=\"http:\/\/gutenberg.org\">Project Gutenberg<\/a> edition of the book (URL is below), opened up MS Word and did the find and replace. 3 minutes later I had Huckleberry Finn &#8211; The Fuckleberry Edition. I listed it was this edition after the title. I also placed my screen name after Twain as an author (it is a derivative work and it&#8217;s not an original work by me &#8211; so both names were appropriate.<\/p>\n<p>I then uploaded the file to Scribd, which if you are not familiar with is an online document sharing service. Probably the largest service of this kind. I uploaded my document and perused it. I then click the embed code to place it on my site in preparation of writing the blog post announcing it. Waiting a second for the code, came back with this work has been removed. What the heck. I click the back button, the work is still there. I click refresh, the work is still there. I click the embed button, this work has been removed. Hmmmm. Maybe I tried to embed it quickly, and I would need to wait a minute before that would work. Then I notice the email sitting in Thunderbird (full email at the end of this post):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We have removed your document &#8220;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn &#8211; Fuckleberry Edition&#8221; (id: 46416259) because our text matching system determined that it was very similar to a work that has been marked as copyrighted and not permitted on Scribd.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So what they are saying is a public domain book is not permitted on Scribd &#8211; and because they have a fingerprint for it that on someone else claims they own it. This means that Scribd signed off on the fingerprint. Really? Really? How hard would it be for Scribd to regularly take the full Gutenberg Archive &#8211; fingerprint all those books and reject the allowance of copyright claims to anything that matches document fingerprints from there. It is services (and companies claiming the copyright) that confuse and relinquish rights for individuals that exist in the public domain. The general person doesn&#8217;t know or understand the public domain &#8211; this makes them understand it even less. This makes some people that gets these notices go &#8211; &#8220;Oops I was mistaken and Twain must own the copyright.&#8221; This mis-educates them and erodes knowledge in an area that Scribd should be trumpeting. I have quite a few things (mostly turn of the century sheet music) uploaded to Scribd. Every item I have uploaded is in the public domain &#8211; or at least I was under a good faith impression it was.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the email I sent Scribd about all of this with their original email at the end:<\/p>\n<p>Dear Scribd,<\/p>\n<p>I received the notice attached at the end of this email about violating a copyright on Scribd and the work was removed. I understand the need to police this action on your site, especially since it allows you to maintain safe harbor provisions under the DMCA. The problem is that the work in question was rudimentary edited copy of Huckleberry Finn. I am assuming unless another work triggered this, that there is an issue if someone is trying to claim that Huckleberry Finn is under copyright.<\/p>\n<p>This file was edited from Gutenberg edition at the following URL:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/76<\/p>\n<p>Since I removed all references to Project Gutenberg I have removed any worry of trademark infringement as per their license. So if this is an issue about a certain edition \/ edits &#8211; my source file is from Project Gutenberg, and you should once again take it up with the original person claiming copyright over this work. The main problem that this calls into question is what other public domain works are being banned from your site? Huckleberry Finn is fairly high profile, what about lesser known public domain works?<\/p>\n<p>I did say my edition was a crude edit &#8211; it was done to coincide with a blog post pointing out that anyone can legally do anything to a public domain book (except on Scribd). The recent controversy about the Huckleberry Finn edition coming out that removes the N word and Injun &#8211; made changing Huckleberry to Fuckleberry a crude but important commentary on the recent controversy. I can thank you now for giving me a new blog post to right instead of that other one.<\/p>\n<p>Received Copyright Notice:<\/p>\n<p>Subject: Your Document Has Been Removed<\/p>\n<p>Hello, creeva2912 &#8212;<\/p>\n<p>We have removed your document &#8220;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn &#8211; Fuckleberry Edition&#8221; (id: 46416259) because our text matching system determined that it was very similar to a work that has been marked as copyrighted and not permitted on Scribd.<\/p>\n<p>Like all automated matching systems, our system is not perfect and occasionally makes mistakes.

I am curious though how this falls in the &#8220;lessons learned&#8221; chart. What other things are they going to claim under copyright? Why can&#8217;t we submit &#8220;known good&#8221; fingerprints of works. The auto-detection of youtube&#8217;s music and video match might not be explorable &#8211; but a text only search sure is.<\/p>\n<p>Here was my response:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>So while I had a case that is fixed &#8211; what about other public domain books? How is this going to fixed from a long term stand point. Should I start taking popular public domain books and submitting them one by one to see if they are erroneously flagged?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m curious now what Scribd&#8217;s solution for handling this going forwarding instead of a case by case basis. Checking Scribd already had many copies of Huckleberry Finn &#8211; so I am confused why they were given a pass and my was flagged. I would also like to know why can&#8217;t Scribd have a known list of public domain books (Huck Finn would easily be in the top 100-500) and have those fingerprinted as &#8220;clean&#8221;.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Waiting<\/p>\n<p>UPDATE &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>Reply from Jason:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We are continuously improving our copyright management system to safeguard against false positives across the board, not just on a case-by-case basis.
