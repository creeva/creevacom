So points are definitely on the TCP\/IP stack in Ubuntu compared to Windows. The difference I noticed was so significant for me that I wonder why more of the power game that attempts to squeeze every last kilobit out of their network connection for latency and speed doesn&#8217;t migrate over for some games.<\/p>\n<p>The issue I don&#8217;t like &#8211; some sites (like my blog) don&#8217;t render the same way &#8211; not terrible or necessarily wonky but different &#8211; my blog for example doesn&#8217;t look right. It&#8217;s not just the fonts that are slightly different &#8211; the site&#8217;s CSS is slightly off in Linux compared to windows. The irony of this ordeal is that I&#8217;m using Firefox in both environments. You would think that there would be the same rendering engine in the back end, but I&#8217;m not so lucky. So this will go into hunting down CSS fixes.<\/p>\n<p>I did get unlucky that Star Wars Galaxies managed to upgrade to a new launcher while I was in the middle of this &#8211; guess I&#8217;ll have to log in via the desktop until I manage to get the launcher working.<\/p>\n<p>WoW is working but is slow &#8211; I need to reduce the resolution from the size it&#8217;s using since that is causing most of my issues &#8211; it just crashes when I change it &#8211; I found some answers on correcting these issues online today though.<\/p>\n<p>All in all successful &#8211; video rendering looks better than Vista &#8211; I&#8217;ll keep posting as I have findings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some random thoughts though I&#8217;m currently away from my laptop.
