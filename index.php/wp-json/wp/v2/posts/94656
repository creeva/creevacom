If you lose you aren&#8217;t remembered. \u00a0Even if you are a winner, celebrating it your past victories just makes you sound like Al Bundy bragging about his three touchdowns in one game.<\/p>\n<p>We had some good people on our football team, and some not so good. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t really buy into the alpha male mentality that is required of you if you are on the football team. \u00a0 Most of their best moments stay on that field dealing with the idea their gladitorial achievements accomplished something in the long term. \u00a0 It made some of them better people, it also left some of them with a lifetime of injuries that started before they were eighteen.<\/p>\n<p>The band however is a different religion. \u00a0 It&#8217;s about joy and celebration. \u00a0 We truly were a team that accomplished something that didn&#8217;t have to tear anyone else down to get there. \u00a0 There is no sin, there is celebration of creation. \u00a0 I could almost quote the mantra from the movie Drumline &#8211; One Band, One Sound. \u00a0 The band (though some people have horror stories) accepted everyone. \u00a0 It was about what you bled, it was about what you loved.<\/p>\n<p>Football players will go on about their time on the field. \u00a0 Band players spent at least twice the amount of time in that church. \u00a0 They would perform during the football games and then do it all over again on Saturday at band festivals. \u00a0 They have doubled it right there, then we add in parades and other performances. \u00a0 The band loves it so much they do it year round. \u00a0 After I graduated the band even had a concert that they held yearly in the auditorium.<\/p>\n<p>I already mentioned the possibility of injuries football players take with them. \u00a0Band players however take knowledge. \u00a0 Even if they never pick up an instrument again in their lives, they have gained the ability to play an instrument and read music. \u00a0 In the last couple years my alma mater has started playing a yearly alumni football game. \u00a0 This is what the draw of the field leads you to &#8211; the desire to return. \u00a0 \u00a0I&#8217;m lucky that I&#8217;m a member of the alumni band. \u00a0 Yearly I get to perform under the lights &#8220;one more time&#8221;. \u00a0 I understand it. \u00a0 The lights have an intoxication and power that drives us back like moths.<\/p>\n<p>Since even in my personal religion I&#8217;m more about celebration, band was a perfect fit. \u00a0 I&#8217;m sure many football players can identify when I say it gave me purpose and meaning. \u00a0It made the boring monotony\u00a0of high school pass that much easier. \u00a0 It was something that filled the void.<\/p>\n<p>I did have a coworker that played both. \u00a0He was on the football team and in the marching band. \u00a0 He would likely be the better one to write an article like this. \u00a0 He could be Switzerland to the feuding that will go on until the end of time. \u00a0 At\u00a0least he could until football is outlawed due to injuries or the band is cut due to funding.<\/p>\n<p>Battle or cooperation is what it finally comes down to. \u00a0 The football team is judged by their win\/loss ratio. \u00a0 You can still love a team even if it loses, the Cleveland Browns are evidence of that. \u00a0 We will always question our love for that team. \u00a0 The band is judged on the straightness of lines and their ability to not miss notes. \u00a0 Both of those things can be covered up and be momentary &#8211; a loss though is forever a statistic.<\/p>\n<p>I do feel bad for my fellow graduates of the football team. \u00a0 They don&#8217;t get to experience those lights and that attraction anymore. \u00a0 If they tried they would be risking serious injury. \u00a0 In that way it is unfair. \u00a0 The band get&#8217;s to practice their religion for a lifetime. \u00a0The oldest member of the alumni band graduated in the 1950&#8217;s. \u00a0 A football player from that era would just be able to go down to the field and wave. \u00a0The musician on the other hand still get&#8217;s down on the field and get&#8217;s under the lights one more time.<\/p>\n<p>Normally I wouldn&#8217;t bother posting anything like this. \u00a0 I normally do my &#8220;here is what I did at alumni band this year&#8221;. \u00a0I never got around to that post. \u00a0 The similarity of churches and how they celebrate religion struck a chord with me that I had to get out. \u00a0 The football team even prayed before the game thinking the Lord above would grant them privilege over the other praying team. \u00a0 The band however believed in celebrating themselves. \u00a0 The students that graduated after me had a mantra &#8220;What time is it? \u00a0Band Time!&#8221; \u00a0It is about what we brought to the table. \u00a0 Both groups left it out on the field &#8211; some just still practice their religion and not watching the televangelist on TV (broadcast sports).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Isn&#8217;t it the eternal debate &#8211; which is better, the Marching Band or the Football Team. \u00a0 Sometimes this is dependent on what school you went to. \u00a0 While we had a multitude of pride &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94657,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94656"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=94656"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94656\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94657"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=94656"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=94656"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=94656"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
