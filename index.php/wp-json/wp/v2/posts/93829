I&#8217;m going on twenty-two years. \u00a0 Which brings up the next one, at the bowling alley some people couldn&#8217;t believe that the other was old enough to drink. \u00a0 They were twenty-two. \u00a0 \u00a0So there is a good chance they weren&#8217;t born yet when I first stepped out on the field at my first show. \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, I remember back in my first season in the 91-92 school year that it was cute of all the class of 1969 that performed in alumni and how they were still doing it after twenty-two years. \u00a0 Well in three more years I will be as old as they were then.<\/p>\n<p>I will continue doing alumni every year I can manage to get to the field. \u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping to be the guy that is 102 years old in a hover wheelchair playing the show. \u00a0 We shall see.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Another year passed where us old folks tested our mettle on the field to see if we still had it. \u00a0 We do. \u00a0 I suffered only minor back pain and a bad ankle &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94334,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93829"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93829"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93829\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94334"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93829"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93829"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93829"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
