My old phone was having issues with the volume of phone calls.\u00a0 \u00a0For the last few months, I pretty much had to move to speaker phone for my calls. \u00a0 I tried different methods to fix it, but nothing worked. \u00a0 It was working well enough that I was going to wait until my contract was up (October 4th) and just buy the latest version. \u00a0 My life is filled with so many conference calls, a well-working phone is extremely important. \u00a0The other features were just gravy.<\/p>\n<p>I had a business trip on October 6th and would be driving past an Apple Store on the way to the office. \u00a0I thought this would be the best time to stroll in upgrade my phone and go about my day. \u00a0 I knew which one I wanted, the 6s in Space Grey and a 128GB of space. \u00a0 This in theory should cost me 399 with a two-year contract renewal. \u00a0It wasn&#8217;t quite that easy though.<\/p>\n<p>I was worried about a couple of things though. \u00a0The first was that most cell phone companies have removed the upgrade phone discount. \u00a0You now had to finance it through the company at an additional cost. \u00a0In the past, this cost was included in your bill in a way you could not see. \u00a0 This is why cell phone plans have gotten &#8220;cheaper&#8221; recently. \u00a0Since companies are separating the phone cost from the bill this reduces the amount of the bill by about $20-30.00. \u00a0 You then purchase into one of the 0% financing plans for the hardware. \u00a0 This normally makes the overall bills you pay each month higher than previously. \u00a0You do have the advantage of yearly upgrades. \u00a0 Apple announced this year that you can finance the phone through them at 0% (with an additional charge over the phone price since it includes Apple Care). \u00a0 AT&amp;T and Verizon are the only companies left doing the old upgrade method.<\/p>\n<p>I arrived at the Apple Store at 11 AM. \u00a0One of the greeters had me about 15 minutes before someone could come over and help me. \u00a0When they came over I gave my specs and said I wanted to use my upgrade. \u00a0 This is where things went wrong. \u00a0 It seems that Apple has stopped accepting the upgrades in the store. \u00a0 He then wanted me to switch plans. \u00a0 I&#8217;m grandfathered into unlimited data and I wasn&#8217;t going to lose that. \u00a0 I also would either have to buy the phone outright (849.00) or use one of the financing plans. \u00a0 He then tried to use the spiel that carriers hide the upgrade cost of the phone in the monthly fee. \u00a0 He said I was a sucker for using the old method and I should change it (so he could sell me the phone). \u00a0 I stated that with my upgrade I could get the phone for 399.00 and my monthly fee wouldn&#8217;t change. \u00a0 For both the house iPhones we get unlimited everything for 75.00 &#8211; with the monthly phone fee (if I did financing) it would be higher than it currently is. \u00a0The salesman said he understood because of the unlimited data and let me on my way. \u00a0 At no point did he concede that even without unlimited data my monthly cost would be cheaper.<\/p>\n<p>I went over to the AT&amp;T store. \u00a0 They were helping a couple of other people. \u00a0Once again the salespeople were trying to sell them on a separate phone financing and separate service plan. \u00a0I rolled my eyes and listened because I knew I had an upgrade. \u00a0 The salespeople made their sale but said the phone was on backorder. \u00a0 I left without going further.<\/p>\n<p>I went to another mall that was on the way to the office. \u00a0I stopped by the AT&amp;T store at this one. \u00a0 I simply asked if they had phones in stock, and they didn&#8217;t. \u00a0 Best Buy mobile was across the way, so I headed over there. \u00a0 I had to wait again until a salesperson was free, but in the interim, they had the phone in stock and set it aside. \u00a0 They originally told me they could do the upgrade. \u00a0 When they started entering the information, they said I could not use the reduced cost. \u00a0 The reason was that I had unlimited data. \u00a0 Because of this, I had to buy the phone outright and then AT&amp;T takes a portion off of my bill (reverse financing). \u00a0 I said no thank you and moved along. \u00a0 This may have been a good option, but since I never heard of this actually reducing someone&#8217;s monthly bill &#8211; I passed.<\/p>\n<p>Making it into the office after lunch I went to the AT&amp;T website and ordered my phone. \u00a0 I noticed that the total I got was 150.00 more than the upgrade. \u00a0I was still saving 300.00 so I went and ordered the phone from the website. \u00a0Once it arrived we realized I ordered it on my wife&#8217;s account. \u00a0Since she wasn&#8217;t due for an upgrade, this is where the additional cost was from. \u00a0 Now that most carriers are getting rid of subsidized phones, we decided to order her a new one also. \u00a0 This one I managed to get this with the right upgrade for 399.00. \u00a0 In the end, we managed to get two new phones for 100.00 more than the single phone would have cost me at the Apple Store or Best Buy Mobile.<\/p>\n<p>The real kicker to this story is while I have the corporate discount on my plan &#8211; for being a loyal customer AT&amp;T reduced the data plans by 25% on each line. \u00a0 This makes my monthly unlimited everything plan 68.00. \u00a0In the end, while Apple tried to tell me how much money I would be throwing away, I saved on both phone lines for the monthly cost and a total of 700.00 off the phones. \u00a0If you have an AT&amp;T upgrade and want a new iPhone, make sure you order it directly through AT&amp;T the first time. \u00a0 This will save you the hassle and run around that I had to deal with.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A new iPhone is released. \u00a0A boy has an upgrade on his contract. \u00a0It is a match made in heaven &#8211;
