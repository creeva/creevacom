since some people may actually still read it, so for them I continued and left it up.\u00a0\u00a0 Since nothing new was being posted I decided I was going to just crosspost my blog posts.\u00a0 I originally hoped to stimulate conversation, but it seems the posts are standing alone in an echo chamber.\u00a0 I did close membership to start spammers from popping up (since I always hated cleaning those out anyways).\u00a0\u00a0 So our peak was over 100 members, now it&#8217;s down to 46.\u00a0\u00a0 I slowly watch people drop off.\u00a0\u00a0 When I am the last one still standing I&#8217;ll take the group offline for good.<\/p>\n<p>I do have backups of the groups since I don&#8217;t want the digital history to be gone, but it will last solely in my hands.\u00a0 In a way it&#8217;s sad to watch a community die off.\u00a0 First I did it with this group, then I relived it with Star Wars Galaxies.\u00a0 Anytime a community is lost for any reasons there should be a sadness; a moment of reflection. \u00a0 I think the main reason it is completely dead these days beyond dynamics changing is the advent of social networking.\u00a0 I&#8217;m friends with many of these same people on different social networks like Myspace and Facebook. \u00a0 This has given them more tools to empower themselves in the delivery of information to their friends. \u00a0 A static mailing list scenario like Yahoo Groups\u00a0 doesn&#8217;t fit into their world anymore.\u00a0 Times, technology, and friendships change &#8211; but looking at the past will show us the journey on how we got to where we are today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A long long time ago I ran a Yahoo Group entitled Marcon Drinkers it was started in 2001.\u00a0\u00a0 Before this group was started my circle of friends had another message board we were using.\u00a0\u00a0 One &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4199"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4199"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4199\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4199"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4199"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4199"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
