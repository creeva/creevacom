Privacy and sharing don&#8217;t bother me. \u00a0 Most of the information I was going to add is mostly publicly accessible via my blog or other public means. \u00a0 Why would I want to spend hours upon hours doing this on Facebook, when only I would enjoy it and there is no long-term strategy to migrate the data out into another format?<\/p>\n<p>I am on the hunt for an alternative. \u00a0I posted yesterday that I am aware of the WordPress plugin (which unfortunately doesn&#8217;t give you date ranges). \u00a0 I am also aware of <a href=\"http:\/\/memolane.com\">Memolane<\/a>, which from my reading didn&#8217;t have a method it outputs the data in a reliable format (I don&#8217;t think you can output it at all). \u00a0 Currently, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any method to do anything similar with any open data standards. \u00a0 \u00a0I would love to have a private (in my home) timeline that would include details and things that I would never share on the open Internet. \u00a0 \u00a0 The dream would be for it to subscribe to a calendar and pull in data from there, arrange pictures by date taken, and be able to pull in data sources from RSS feeds, Twitter, and other sources to give a comprehensive view of my life that I could work backward in time from.<\/p>\n<p>Once the data sourcing problem is solved I would love it if videos, pictures, and text in flat HTML files\/ directories as well as a database. \u00a0 This would give me the power of portability with the speed and comparison of data that you could do with a database. \u00a0 For me, this would be a win\/win design. \u00a0 Your data would always be able to be recovered, copied, moved, and backed up easily.<\/p>\n<p>I was explaining to Xie last night that it is a catch-22. \u00a0I don&#8217;t obsessively record my data since there is no good way to store or visualize it. \u00a0 \u00a0Since I can&#8217;t find a method to store and visualize it to my liking &#8211; I don&#8217;t obsessively record my data. \u00a0 I do have a WordPress installation on my laptop that aggregates more information than even my public blog does &#8211; it really however is a hack and not really good enough. \u00a0The hunt continues&#8230;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So last week I started filling out my Facebook timeline. \u00a0 The idea behind it is pretty cool in the sense you give yourself a time machine to look back at your life. \u00a0 I &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":102935,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/77034"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=77034"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/77034\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/102935"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=77034"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=77034"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=77034"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
