Now in a controlled environment like Wikipedia where they have the volunteers to handle un-authorized edits, wiki&#8217;s can be a great thing. In the hands of exposing your edits to the audience of a major newspaper &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t have gone that route.<\/p>\n<p>What they were finding is that people would make their own slant on the editorials &#8211; such as changing the word abortion ot the word murder. They also were inundated with spam and porn ads. Sounds like they didn&#8217;t have the best idea on the onset of setting up a wiki or properly staffing what would be a high profile use of the technology. This is technology that is meant to be changed and updated. That ability alone has made some people suspect of <a href=\"http:\/\/wikipedia.org\">Wikipedia<\/a>. Newspapers are dying out in America &#8211; but this example shows why such high profile companies can not hand the keys to the car to just everyone asking. Citizen media has it&#8217;s place, but old media shouldn&#8217;t be attempting to tag it on without understanding hte consequences or the work involved in maintaining it.<\/p>\n<p>I wonder if anyone got fired?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here A couple news sources are reporting today (here, here, and here) that the LA Times is suspending their program of using a wiki for editorials.
