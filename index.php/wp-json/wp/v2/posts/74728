This was news I was not expecting to hear last night. \u00a0 My son had just finished eating dinner and I sat down on the couch for a quick RSS read-through on the iPhone. \u00a0 There it was on from the Mashable feed &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2011\/10\/05\/breaking-steve-jobs-has-died\/\">Steve Jobs Has Died<\/a>. \u00a0 Quickly I scroll down, this can&#8217;t be right. \u00a0 Steve is still going to lead technology design into the future. \u00a0 Mashable must have been hacked. \u00a0 Then I saw Tech Crunch announce it, then another, and another. \u00a0 It sunk in and I told Xie. \u00a0It didn&#8217;t hit her at first either. \u00a0 We saw the news before it exploded online, and we didn&#8217;t know how to take it.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best quotes I saw online was &#8220;This must have it felt like for my parents when John Lennon died&#8221;. \u00a0 Some people in my generation would give the &#8220;rock star&#8221; death to Kurt Cobain. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t even like Nirvana until years after his death. \u00a0 I did know when he died the world changed. \u00a0 Steve Jobs was also a rock star. \u00a0 He was a visionary and he changed technology forever. \u00a0 I had to deal with the extreme Apple haters yesterday (some friends, some just online) that made inappropriate comments. \u00a0 Within hours of the announcement, that&#8217;s just wrong. \u00a0Regardless of where you stand on the Mac vs. PC legacy, this is a man who has touched you in so many ways that you are not aware of. \u00a0 His influence is extended into just about every facet of the modern computer you own.<\/p>\n<p>If you like Windows and its graphical interface, you can thank Mr. Jobs. \u00a0 You needed to use floppies once upon a time, thank Mr. Jobs (for the 3.5&#8243; inch design). \u00a0 You decided you are past floppies and don&#8217;t need them anymore, you can thank Mr. Jobs for leading the way in removing them from machines. \u00a0 I could wax on and on about Pixar, iPhones, and iPads &#8211; but you can get that coverage anywhere else and you should read it from people who write better than I do. \u00a0 \u00a0I&#8217;m just going to give you a few personal Apple-related stories.<\/p>\n<p>My first experience with Apple may have been in the computer lab at Open Door Christian School, unfortunately, those days don&#8217;t stick with me. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t really remember using a computer in school until high school, and then that was a dos-based system. \u00a0 The first experience I remember was my next-door neighbor when I was between 4-6 grades had a Mac Plus. \u00a0 It was a sleek all-in-one box that put my Commodore Vic-20 to shame. \u00a0 We played a few games on it when his parents gave him permission. \u00a0The most frequent one was one of the Ultima games. \u00a0 Those days were completely black and white glory and it was fantastic. \u00a0 In 1988 we moved to Vermilion, and I was stuck again with only having access to my Vic-20.<\/p>\n<p>By my senior year of high school, we got a PC in the house and I was entrenched as a PC guy. \u00a0 I wouldn&#8217;t say at first I had any real feelings about the Mac vs. PC wars. \u00a0 They were the same right? \u00a0 At least that was what I thought at the time. \u00a0 Then moving forward I became a PC technician at a PC shop. \u00a0Occasionally we got Macs that came in and fixing them between all the technicians was a hope and prayer. \u00a0 It was like the time I fixed a Novell file server at a doctor&#8217;s office, I still have no idea what I did beyond using the help file and typing random commands. \u00a0One common problem was that the motherboard battery would die on the Mac and then the computer would refuse to boot. \u00a0We fixed a few of these. \u00a0This seemed ridiculous though. \u00a0 Why would a computer not boot if the CMOS battery died? \u00a0 PCs would still boot. \u00a0 Macs suck. \u00a0Apple limited you too much from tinkering beneath the hood. \u00a0 Being a DOS maven I hated that. \u00a0 I wanted to tinker, tweak, and hack my computer to do things it should have. \u00a0 You couldn&#8217;t do that with a Mac. \u00a0 There was also the Apple Tax issue. \u00a0 I was a firm PC and all Macs sucked. \u00a0 I chose my place in the war.<\/p>\n<p>Sometime in 97-98, I did some PC work for a sales rep at B&amp;K Automotive in Vermilion on freelance time. \u00a0 What was my payment? \u00a0 30-50 Apple IIs. \u00a0 I had to do two trips in my escort having it completely weighed down with every inch of available space that I didn&#8217;t need to drive to move them to storage at the Vermilion Haunted School House. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t have room at home to store them (I had moved out of my apartment and was living with my mother or Xie&#8217;s parents at the time). \u00a0 A group of this hauled them all upstairs and put them into storage. \u00a0 We had extra parts and peripherals galore. \u00a0 There was a guy named Greg that also worked at the schoolhouse that I would have my epic Apple Vs. Microsoft arguments with. \u00a0He managed to put together a top-of-the-line Apple II for himself and they played games on it in the basement of the schoolhouse. \u00a0 I always meant to save one perfect one for myself, but I never did. \u00a0 They were all destroyed or removed from the building before I ever had a chance. \u00a0They are gone like my TRS-80 and CoCo that I had received around that time period.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: revert;\">OSX then came out. \u00a0There wasn&#8217;t the same reason to hate the Mac. \u00a0I respected them and what they could then do. \u00a0 A few years later we purchased Xie the first Mac in the house, the original Mac Mini. \u00a0 Unfortunately, the Mac Mini was the bastard child. \u00a0We liked it. \u00a0It looked beautiful. \u00a0 Unfortunately, we were ingrained windows users and didn&#8217;t do much with it. \u00a0 It was always the question of what can we do with it. \u00a0It didn&#8217;t help that each of us had at least two windows computers and the Mac was an add-on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes there, Xie received her first iPod. \u00a0 It was a 20 GB 2nd or 3rd generation. \u00a0It actually is still in the house somewhere and works. \u00a0 She then upgraded to a first-gen nano and I received the original iPod. \u00a0 After we moved into the new house she lost the Nano for a span of two weeks. \u00a0 We found it on the upper patio sitting outside in the weather. \u00a0It had rained a couple of times during the &#8220;we can&#8217;t find it stage&#8221;. \u00a0 It had been dry outside for 2-3 days before we found it, we took it in, charged it, and it worked like a champ. \u00a0 About after that incident, Xie received an iPod Classic 120GB (having missed the window for the 200GB and being annoyed at that fact). \u00a0 I inherited the nano and loved it for months. \u00a0 One day while working on the car I hopped into the passenger seat, the nano was in my back pocket and cracked in half. \u00a0 It was a good little device that had a life that ended too soon. The last iPod in the house was purchased about 2 months ago, a shuffle for Xie to use during workouts. \u00a0I still want one of those for the fashion style more than real use.<\/p>\n<p>Two and a half years ago we started our move into the full Apple ecosystem by purchasing two iPhone 3GSs. \u00a0 I thought the first gen iPhone was limited by not being able to install apps and being very limited basis, by the time my contract was up and ready to get a new phone &#8211; we were eyeing the 3GS. \u00a0 Since then the iPhone has become part of our daily lives. \u00a0 I couldn&#8217;t live without my phone. \u00a0I upgraded to the iPhone 4 last year, and plan on upgrading to the new 4S. \u00a0 I get so much out of the device that the cost is worth the upgrade. \u00a0 Like I did say in yesterday&#8217;s piece, Xie is receiving the first 4S, I get the second. \u00a0 Alexander is currently rocking my old de-activated 3GS. \u00a0 I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be upgrading to the iPhone 4 once I get my new one.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes two years ago the Mac Air was announced. \u00a0I had to hear all the complaints about lack of power and lack of a CD drive, but I so wanted the device. \u00a0 While I was at NASA I managed to beta-test the Mac Air for use in the environment. \u00a0 While I still used a PC a bit this was my first regular usage of OSX. \u00a0 I loved it, but I also did love my PC. \u00a0 My work and play were becoming more and more browser-based. \u00a0 I could do 80% of whatever I needed to do on whatever platform I wanted.\u00a0 For the remaining 20%, I just jumped between machines. \u00a0 During that time it was my favorite laptop I had ever used. \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, it was taken from me and repurposed to upper management. \u00a0 I was given a Mac Pro, but it wasn&#8217;t the same. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t like it quite as much, of course, it was also a couple of years old. \u00a0 I stopped really using my Mac and went back to the PC.<\/p>\n<p>As I was preparing to leave NASA for a new job, the iPad was announced. \u00a0 I wanted one. \u00a0 It was just like the phone that was joined at my hip, but I could do more on it. \u00a0I, unfortunately, did not get one. \u00a0Xie did (64GB WiFi). \u00a0She loves it and uses it daily. \u00a0 She is a maverick switching between the iPhone, her computer, and her iPad, and using the right device for the job. \u00a0 We have not yet purchased an iPad 2, but I&#8217;m sure when we do I&#8217;ll inherit the iPad 1.<\/p>\n<p>Last year the Apple TV 2 was announced. \u00a0 This also has become a staple in our household. \u00a0We don&#8217;t have cable or OTA signals that reach our house. \u00a0 All of our TV consumption is done via ripped DVDs and Netflix. \u00a0 We are also watching something new all the time. \u00a0 I did get sick of transcoding everything to MP4 &#8211; so our Apple TV is now jailbroken and running XBMC. \u00a0 So between XBMC and Netflix, we can pretty much watch whatever we want. \u00a0 We use the iPad or the iPhones as a remote and everything works wonderfully (the user interface for XBMC is a wee bit laggy though).<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: initial; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: revert;\">Finally, about 3 months ago we purchased two MacBook Pros. \u00a0These are our new daily machines. \u00a0 We are using them almost exclusively. \u00a0 We still have Windows 7 desktops, but we don&#8217;t use them nearly as much. \u00a0The usage model has definitely swapped on its head between PC and OSX. \u00a0 Mostly because running Windows in virtual box allows me to run whatever I need on a single machine. \u00a0Modern technology is wonderful. \u00a0 I consider myself OS agnostic, but the hardware quality of this laptop is fantastic. \u00a0I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll ever be able to go back to not owning a non-Apple laptop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>So to sum up, I&#8217;m still mostly a PC person (that uses OSX on his personal\/work laptop). \u00a0 I have even given two Apple TV 2&#8217;s and 2 iPod Touchs as gifts. \u00a0My household has a history with Apple on our journey to get to where we are today.<\/p>\n<p>Apple Products we have gone through:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>30 &#8211; 50 Apple IIs of various flavors<\/li>\n<li>Mac Mini<\/li>\n<li>Mac LC and a Clone Mac (stories not worth mentioning, but they were owned and used somewhat on par with the Mac Mini in the house).<\/li>\n<li>4 iPods<\/li>\n<li>3 iPhones (so far)<\/li>\n<li>1 iPad (so far)<\/li>\n<li>1 Apple TV (so far)<\/li>\n<li>2 MacBook Pros (so far)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For a PC person that is quite the list. \u00a0 I can defend Apple, and if I&#8217;m not careful I might one day become strictly an Apple Computer user. \u00a0 Until then, thank you Mr. Jobs for what you have given us. \u00a0Thank you for pushing Apple, Microsoft, Google, and a myriad of other companies to improve and compete so that the consumer wins. \u00a0 Thank you.<\/p>\n<p>Some other stories to check out<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2011\/10\/05\/steve-jobs-remembered\/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29\">Steve Jobs Remembered: 10 of His Most Magical Moments<\/a><\/p>\n<p>What Steve Meant Back Then<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mashable.com\/2011\/10\/05\/steve-jobs-quotes\/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29\">15 Inspirational Steve Jobs Quotes\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wow.
