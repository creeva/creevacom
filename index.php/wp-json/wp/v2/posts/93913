\u00a0I have no\u00a0clue, which is probably why almost no one calls it that. \u00a0I&#8217;m also guessing that this person has one or two piercings in his left ear.<\/p>\n<p>The person is smoking. \u00a0 I&#8217;m going to guess that it is a Marlboro Red Cigarette. \u00a0Looking at the guy I would guess this is from a hard pack, soft packs would somehow always get crushed for this individual. \u00a0He probably has only been smoking 2-3 years. \u00a0He likely started smoking to meet people of the opposite sex.<\/p>\n<p>We noticed that he is wearing a nineties style bomber jacket. \u00a0 This jacket was likely a hand-me down that he received from his maternal uncle (just a wild guess). \u00a0 Beneath the jacket is the requisite nineties flannel shirt, unbuttoned to show another shirt beneath that. \u00a0 This also was very much the style of the time.<\/p>\n<p>Strangely this person is wearing pants. \u00a0 Normally I would expect someone like this to be wearing shorts. \u00a0 The time of year doesn&#8217;t matter, so I&#8217;m assuming all his shorts were dirty this day. \u00a0 Even today, I would assume this person&#8217;s friends would find it weird when he wears pants.<\/p>\n<p>If I can abstract a little more than what we see in the image, I would guess he drives a compact. \u00a0Something like a red 1986 Ford Escort that his grandfather purchased for him at the price of $500.00. \u00a0The ashtray was likely overflowing at all times, the paint was scratched to hell, and his friends loved to neutral drop the transmission. \u00a0The rear drivers side tail lights were probably smashed out due to backing into a van in the middle of a squirt gun battle. \u00a0 This damage would likely allow a cool breeze to go through the car in the middle of winter.<\/p>\n<p>He probably is a computer technician at a small repair shop the next town over. \u00a0 He probably earns between $7.50-9.00 an hour, which is when minimum wage was $5.00. \u00a0 The date this is taken he is likely living at his mother&#8217;s house. \u00a0 The following year I bet he got a two bedroom townhouse with his fianc\u00e9e (this is all guessing of course).<\/p>\n<p>This of course is just a random observation of a random person from 1997. \u00a0The view is like a looking-glass that we can observe and make judgements about our life way back in the dark ages. \u00a0In no way is this me at all. \u00a0 Nope couldn&#8217;t be, I&#8217;m a much different person.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; What we have above is a random and average twenty-one year old in the current fashion of the day. \u00a0Let&#8217;s start from the top and work down. \u00a0We start with the ball cap. \u00a0The &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93914,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93913"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93913"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93913\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93914"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93913"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93913"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93913"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
