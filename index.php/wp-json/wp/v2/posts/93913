Let&#8217;s start from the top and work down. We start with the ball cap. The bill is slight tilted compared to the complete flat bills that are the style on hats today. We then notice the unkept slacker style hair, not at all beiberish. Our eyes are then drawn to the round sound glasses of the type normally reserved for hippies.<\/p>\n<p>The facial hair is commonly called a goatee, but it isn&#8217;t. The real term for that facial hair is a Van Dyke. Why is it called that? I have no\u00a0clue, which is probably why almost no one calls it that. I&#8217;m also guessing that this person has one or two piercings in his left ear.<\/p>\n<p>The person is smoking. I&#8217;m going to guess that it is a Marlboro Red Cigarette. Looking at the guy I would guess this is from a hard pack, soft packs would somehow always get crushed for this individual. He probably has only been smoking 2-3 years. He likely started smoking to meet people of the opposite sex.<\/p>\n<p>We noticed that he is wearing a nineties style bomber jacket. This jacket was likely a hand-me down that he received from his maternal uncle (just a wild guess). Beneath the jacket is the requisite nineties flannel shirt, unbuttoned to show another shirt beneath that. This also was very much the style of the time.<\/p>\n<p>Strangely this person is wearing pants. Normally I would expect someone like this to be wearing shorts. The time of year doesn&#8217;t matter, so I&#8217;m assuming all his shorts were dirty this day. Even today, I would assume this person&#8217;s friends would find it weird when he wears pants.<\/p>\n<p>If I can abstract a little more than what we see in the image, I would guess he drives a compact. Something like a red 1986 Ford Escort that his grandfather purchased for him at the price of $500.00. The ashtray was likely overflowing at all times, the paint was scratched to hell, and his friends loved to neutral drop the transmission. The rear drivers side tail lights were probably smashed out due to backing into a van in the middle of a squirt gun battle. This damage would likely allow a cool breeze to go through the car in the middle of winter.<\/p>\n<p>He probably is a computer technician at a small repair shop the next town over. He probably earns between $7.50-9.00 an hour, which is when minimum wage was $5.00. The date this is taken he is likely living at his mother&#8217;s house. The following year I bet he got a two bedroom townhouse with his fianc\u00e9e (this is all guessing of course).<\/p>\n<p>This of course is just a random observation of a random person from 1997. The view is like a looking-glass that we can observe and make judgements about our life way back in the dark ages. In no way is this me at all. Nope couldn&#8217;t be, I&#8217;m a much different person.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; What we have above is a random and average twenty-one year old in the current fashion of the day.
