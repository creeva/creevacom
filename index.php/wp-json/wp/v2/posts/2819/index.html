I&#8217;ve stated before, yet I&#8217;ll mention it again for this series that I do it so readers can access me where they want. Yesterday I <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/05\/19\/is-is-possible-to-out-scoble-the-scobleizer\/\" class=\"broken_link\">posted that I was making it a goal of mine<\/a> to see how many possible services. Since I&#8217;m doing this I figured that could I get my information to my readers on how to do this, the why is a little tougher to answer. While this information could theoretically be used for spam blogs, I sincerely hope that you do it to keep in touch with your friends.<\/p>\n<p>Crossposting did start out as keeping in touch with friends in other services so I didn&#8217;t have to login into them. Very truly there are only a handful of web services that I truly interact with, I&#8217;ll leave comments or talk to users when I actually do log in, but the path where I create original content is quite narrow. <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\">My blog<\/a> (where you may be reading this) of course is my primary outlet where I write, the secondary service I use incessantly is <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/creeva\">twitter<\/a>. Pictures and movies of course have completely different avenues of entries into the interwebs, but I do so much more when it comes to text. Through the course of this series, I will be covering text, video, audio, and metadata crossposting.<\/p>\n<p>Later today I will be starting with crossposting to Vox and from there I&#8217;ll write an article per service, there will be some overlapping techniques to get data into service, but I won&#8217;t be using the same technique on the same day. So if I use e-mail crossposting as a method, the next will be either an RSS entry or a helper site. I won&#8217;t be releasing all of my secret sauce, but just enough of it so you should be able to figure out the missing pieces for yourself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned in passing in the past that I do crosspost across the interwebs.
