I used to do all of her proof reading for her college homework when I was in high school, and I was responsible for the rewrites.\u00a0 When I was about fourteen she said she was smarter then me.\u00a0\u00a0 What she may have meant to said was wiser, though I don&#8217;t think that was the case, since if she was wiser or smarter she would have said the word wiser.\u00a0\u00a0 Also for anyone wishing to defend her on that one, she still says she is smarter (Oprah must have told her she was).\u00a0 I have a standing offer to pay for an IQ test so we can settle this once and for all, if she is write (highly unlikely) I may just kill myself since it will be proof that intelligence means nothing. On a side note recently I was just talking about sitting for the Mensa exam.\u00a0 I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m Mensa smart, I may not be, but I&#8217;m confident enough to actually sit for the test.<\/p>\n<p>The last thing is I get insane over little requests people ask of me.\u00a0\u00a0 I better be in the right frame of mind because I can go ballistic if it&#8217;s something they can do for themselves. \u00a0 I&#8217;ll give you the story I use to describe this whenever I talk to someone about her. \u00a0 When I was in high school I told my mother I was going to be taking a bath (yes I&#8217;m a boy and I like baths get over it).\u00a0 She acknowledged me and said she was going ot cook dinner.\u00a0 At this point everything is fine and dandy. \u00a0 About 10 minutes later I&#8217;m in the middle of reading a book and my mother starts screamiming my name. \u00a0 Now this isn&#8217;t a your in trouble name scream, nor was it a where are you at name scream.\u00a0 What it sounded like was the &#8220;OMG THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE&#8221; scream. \u00a0 I threw on a towel and rush down the stairs.<\/p>\n<p>Well the emergency?\u00a0 My mother needed a wash cloth to do dishes .\u00a0 Her answer about me being in the bath?\u00a0 &#8220;I forgot&#8221;.\u00a0 In ten minutes she forgot what she had been told and acknowledged (and I&#8217;m sure she heard the bath water run) and put all of that aside for her immediate need of a wash cloth.\u00a0\u00a0 To make matters worse, she thought I was down in my room.\u00a0\u00a0 Now our family was a plit level.\u00a0 The kitchen on the main floor, the bathroom on the second floor, and my bedroom on the lower floor.\u00a0\u00a0 In theory give or take ten feet I would have had to expend the same amount of energy to come from my room or the bathroom to come to the kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0 She would have expended half the energy (minus the energy to start yelling) to go down to the second floor and get it herself.\u00a0 It was absolute pure laziness.\u00a0\u00a0 I pointed it out to her, and she didn&#8217;t care.\u00a0\u00a0 She wasn&#8217;t old or invalid, she was healthy and approxiamately the same age as I am now.\u00a0\u00a0 The worst part, I was dripping wet, freezing, and I still had to get the washcloth.<\/p>\n<p>I was a sucker and should have said no, but I was a mama&#8217;s boy.\u00a0 That story though is an example of many many things that are quite similar.\u00a0\u00a0 Because of her necessity or decorating the house for the holidays, I now loath decorating for the holidays\/\u00a0 I have never had a christmas tree in my\u00a0 house, that may change next year with the kid on the way.\u00a0\u00a0 Compared to my mother&#8217;s house and her record breaking three christmas trees she did one year, my house will be quite sparse.<\/p>\n<p>My mother likes to tell people how things are to be decorated and have everyone else do the work.\u00a0\u00a0 After the divorce I became the man of\u00a0 the house.\u00a0\u00a0 I learned to loath the holidays.\u00a0 When your mother is healthy you shouldn&#8217;t be fifteen and being Santa Claus setting up the tree late at night for your siblings, but yet I was.\u00a0 I love the holidays, I just hat emy mothers version of them.\u00a0 These days though i&#8217;m preferring Halloween over Christmas, black and gory for the win.<\/p>\n<p>Ok\u00a0 I&#8217;m stopping now otherwise this will become the post that will never end.<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 2 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 3 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 4 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 5 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 6 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 7 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 8 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 9 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 10 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 11 here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 12 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 13 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 14 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 15 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 16 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 17 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Day late&#8230;
