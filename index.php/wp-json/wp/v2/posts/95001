It was 49.99 with free shipping so it would pay for itself in 3 months over changing the phone service.<\/p>\n<p>The device came and I let it sit for a few days. \u00a0 I eventually got around to trying and it work on Friday night. \u00a0 The first thing was getting my son a Google Voice number again. \u00a0 You would think would be a straightforward proposition, but it was not. \u00a0 \u00a0I hooked up a phone to my home phone line and verified it with Google Voice. \u00a0 I then browsed the phone numbers. \u00a0 I found one I thought looked good and selected it. \u00a0 Once I clicked the button, I received the message that would be the bane of my evening &#8220;There was an error with your request. \u00a0Please try again.&#8221; I tried again. \u00a0 It was the same result. \u00a0 The service might be busy so I waited awhile and tried again. \u00a0 I still wasn&#8217;t having any luck. \u00a0Then I started searching online.<\/p>\n<p>One of the things that came up was the fact if a phone had been used by Google Voice before it couldn&#8217;t be activated in a different account. \u00a0 I have two google voice accounts and this number wasn&#8217;t bound to anything. \u00a0Just in case though, I would need a new number. \u00a0 Since our cell phones were already activated to our respective accounts I could not use that. \u00a0 I downloaded an app for my phone that allowed you to generate burner numbers. \u00a0 These temporary numbers would work for a set amount of time and then disappear. \u00a0 I paid $1.99 to get a number that would work for 14 days. \u00a0I received the number and verified Google Voice, then chose a new number to add. \u00a0The problem was I received the same error message.<\/p>\n<p>It seems that something can trigger on Google&#8217;s backend that can block the addition or reactivation of a Google Voice account. \u00a0There was a thread where they could reset an account, but they put a notice that they no longer did that. \u00a0 Even if I could move forward on that, it would take days to resolve. \u00a0 I was impatient and there has never been a thing like a Google customer support line. \u00a0I was on my own and I was going to brute force this scenario.<\/p>\n<p>I removed all phones from my son&#8217;s Google Voice account. \u00a0 I then opened a new Gmail account. \u00a0Using this account I forwarded all email messages to my son&#8217;s account &#8211; which in theory should have forwarded it to myself and my wife. \u00a0Then I went to Google Voice and prepared for the worst. \u00a0 I signed up for the account and verified the number to the burner number I got. \u00a0Then I went to choose a new number &#8211; and this time it worked. \u00a0 I then went and configured the Obi device. \u00a0I called the number from my cell phone and everything worked. \u00a0I then set the burner phone number to never ring and tested it again. \u00a0 Everything was still working as expected. \u00a0All text messages, voicemails, and missed call notifications would be forwarded to this email address. \u00a0Everything should be right.<\/p>\n<p>Now it was time to test. \u00a0 I sent a text message to the new number. \u00a0 It came through to the new email address, but not his existing one. \u00a0A Gmail filter later and another test it was getting to his real email address. \u00a0 It seems Gmail doesn&#8217;t like forwarding messages it already forwarded on another account. \u00a0 This is likely to prevent an accidental loop where email just keeps flowing constantly until an email box is full. \u00a0 Since there are different alerts depending on missed calls, text messages, and voicemails &#8211; I had to configure a few filters that forwarded these messages to my son&#8217;s account, my wife&#8217;s account, and my own. \u00a0This keeps the whole vigilant on what is going on in your child&#8217;s life.<\/p>\n<p>The phone he is using is a standard home cordless phone. \u00a0So he won&#8217;t be doing text messaging anytime soon. \u00a0However, he loves it as is. \u00a0 His nickname is even part of the phone number (yes I&#8217;m that much of a geek). \u00a0The last few days as I have been on the road we have been talking on his phone. \u00a0 This gives him just a bit more freedom than he has had &#8211; since in theory, he can have people call him. \u00a0 Whenever he does get a cell phone, he can configure the service for that and keep the same number through however many iterations of phones he goes through in his life. \u00a0 My wife and I will answer the phone first until he learns about wrong numbers and such. \u00a0 Still, it is something more in this world he has for himself.<\/p>\n<p>As for the Obi box. \u00a0If there are no issues in the next few months I plan on purchasing 1-2 more of them. \u00a0 Then my wife will be able to use her old rotary phone to receive calls. \u00a0I doubt Google Voice supports pulse dialing, so likely it won&#8217;t work for outbound. \u00a0 Just the nostalgia though of having the ability to answer a rotary phone again would be neat. \u00a0 I plan on getting something more comfortable than an iPhone when I have long conference calls. \u00a0 So this would be the reason I would get one for myself. \u00a0 Everything old is new again. \u00a0 Everything is working. \u00a0It was a frustrating adventure. \u00a0All my son wanted was to receive calls and make them &#8211; and it turned into this.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have reached that dreaded age that every parent must face. \u00a0 The one where your child wants to be able to make their own phone calls and receive calls from friends. \u00a0 My child &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95030,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95001"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95001"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95001\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95030"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95001"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95001"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95001"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
