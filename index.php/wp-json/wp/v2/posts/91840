I just don&#8217;t really remember.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, I was brought up to the competition kiosk. \u00a0 Since there was no Internet at the time, I don&#8217;t think I knew what the competition games were going to be. \u00a0 If I had known, I would have rented the games to become more familiar with them. \u00a0 As it was, of the three competition games I was only familiar with one of the three.<\/p>\n<p>The competition cartridge consisted of three games. \u00a0 These were Super Mario Bros., Rad Racer, and\u00a0Tetris. \u00a0 For Super Mario Bros. you had to get 50 coins. \u00a0 You then had to complete a special race in Rad Racer. \u00a0 The remaining time\u00a0was spent\u00a0in\u00a0Tetris. \u00a0 You had 6 minutes and 21 seconds to complete the gauntlet. \u00a0Then there was a formula to figure out the high score. \u00a0 You can\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nintendo_World_Championships\">read more about it on the Wikipedia Page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Super Mario Bros. was the only game I was\u00a0familiar\u00a0with. \u00a0I had never played Rad Racer, so that slowed me down the most. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t remember if I had played\u00a0Tetris\u00a0at all at that time. \u00a0If I had it would have been the\u00a0Tengen\u00a0version of\u00a0Tetris\u00a0and not the Nintendo one. \u00a0 I understood the rules, I just was proficient, not a great player though. \u00a0 \u00a0<em>Compare this to about 7 -8 years ago when I was training for the Gameboy Tetris World record&#8230;..<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I did not score the required amount to go to round 2. \u00a0 That was fine, I could do it again. \u00a0 Unfortunately, that was when Pa wanted to leave. \u00a0 He was done and bored and ready to go. \u00a0 In his mind, I did what I came to do and we could then leave. \u00a0 We couldn&#8217;t wait around to try again. \u00a0 We could not waste hours playing video games. \u00a0 It was time to leave. \u00a0 I may have gotten a reprieve of twenty minutes, but that would have been the most.<\/p>\n<p>I rolled the dice and ended up with my grandfather and missed out on advancing to the competition. \u00a0 I did attempt it though. \u00a0 I can also say out of the big events in my life it was one of the views my grandfather and I did something. \u00a0 We have gone to car shows and fairs. \u00a0 Those were all things he was interested in though. I can say this is one of the things that I know he did just for me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now you are playing with power. \u00a0 That is what Nintendo was telling us in the late eighties. \u00a0I was a complete Nintendo boy. \u00a0 I got my first job just to get an NES. &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":91842,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/91840"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=91840"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/91840\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/91842"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=91840"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=91840"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=91840"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
