That is what Nintendo was telling us in the late eighties. &nbsp;I was a complete Nintendo boy. &nbsp; I got&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2009\/01\/08\/my-first-job\/\" class=\"broken_link\">my first job<\/a>&nbsp;just to get an NES. &nbsp;Eventually my grandparents got me a subscription to Nintendo Power, the promotional magazine for Nintendo for Christmas 1990. &nbsp;The year before the&nbsp;Powerfest&nbsp;I was buying each issue as it came along.<\/p>\n<p>One day while I was watching cartoons afterschool a commercial came on it was about the Nintendo World Championship and how it was coming to my town. &nbsp; I had to go. &nbsp; I was great at video games. &nbsp;I needed&nbsp;to be&nbsp;there. &nbsp;I needed to compete. &nbsp;I could go all the way. &nbsp; &nbsp;At least that was my thinking.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember how it all played out. &nbsp;I must have begged both of my parents. &nbsp; Neither could take me. &nbsp;I am assuming my father had to work and my mother didn&#8217;t want to wrangle three other kids while I played video games. &nbsp; I then appealed to my grandparents. &nbsp; My grandmother couldn&#8217;t go, but my grandfather could.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/2690000455_c05658f8d0-1-1.jpg\" class=\"broken_link\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"2690000455_c05658f8d0\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/2690000455_c05658f8d0-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"430\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Pa and I many years earlier<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a little sidetrack for a moment. &nbsp;While I&#8217;m sure I consented to go with my grandfather as a last resort, he is the last man you want to take you out for an event. &nbsp; &nbsp;He likes things operating on his time. &nbsp; He would drag you to a tractor show and look around ten times longer than what any kid would find interesting. &nbsp; However, if it wasn&#8217;t one of his interests, your time was at a minimum.<\/p>\n<p>The infamous family story is about a family trip to Cedar Point. &nbsp; My grandparents were living in Michigan. &nbsp;They decided to take my mother and my uncle to Cedar Point in Ohio. &nbsp;The drive was about three hours each way. &nbsp; They got to Cedar Point and started to have a good time. &nbsp; About two hours into the family trip, my grandfather decided it was time to go. &nbsp; He had seen it, so he&nbsp;was ready to leave. &nbsp; This is not the man I wanted to take my so I could indulge myself in video games. &nbsp;Unfortunately it was to go with him or to not go at all. &nbsp; So together we went.<\/p>\n<p>It was a gray overcast day in Ohio on March 17, 1990. &nbsp; There was drizzle in the air in downtown Cleveland. &nbsp; None of that matter though. &nbsp;I was walking from our parking spot to the Nintendo World Championships and nothing else mattered. &nbsp; There is a chance we purchased the tickets ahead of time, but we may have purchased them at the door. &nbsp; Either way Ticketmaster managed to get their cut of the revenue. &nbsp; &nbsp; The place was jam packed with kids of all ages. &nbsp; A sea of video game lovers as far as the eye can see.<\/p>\n<p>Of course after twenty-two years I could be looking at all of this through the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia. &nbsp; I was only thirteen and it was fantastic. &nbsp; I&#8217;m sure this is part of the reason I&#8217;m heavily into retro video games today.<\/p>\n<p>There were kiosks everywhere. &nbsp; They were setup so you could play the latest NES games. &nbsp; If I remember correctly all the major publishers were there. &nbsp; The kiosks (once again memory) had a switch that you jump between different games. &nbsp; This was to make sure that no single kiosk area was completely overwhelmed. &nbsp; There was a time limit in playing the games so they could move people through as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>In the center you had register for your chance to compete. &nbsp; &nbsp;This part is fuzzy though. &nbsp;If I remember correctly you were given a ticket with a number and when your groups&nbsp;was called&nbsp;you went on through. &nbsp; I could be wrong though it might have been that we waited in line &#8211; I just don&#8217;t really remember.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually I&nbsp;was brought&nbsp;up to the competition kiosk. &nbsp; Since there was not an Internet&nbsp;at the time,&nbsp;I don&#8217;t think I knew what the competition games were going&nbsp;to be. &nbsp; If I had known, I would have rented the games to become more&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;with them. &nbsp; As it was, of the three competition games I was only familiar with one of the three.<\/p>\n<p>The competition cartridge consisted of three games. &nbsp; These were Super Mario Bros., Rad Racer, and&nbsp;Tetris. &nbsp; For Super Mario Bros. you had to get 50 coins. &nbsp; You then had to complete a special race in Rad Racer. &nbsp; The remaining time&nbsp;was spent&nbsp;in&nbsp;Tetris. &nbsp; You had 6 minutes and 21 seconds to complete the gauntlet. &nbsp;Then there was a formula to figure out the high score. &nbsp; You can&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nintendo_World_Championships\">read more about it on the Wikipedia Page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Super Mario Bros. was the only game I was&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;with. &nbsp;I had never played Rad Racer, so that slowed me down the most. &nbsp; I don&#8217;t remember if I had played&nbsp;Tetris&nbsp;at all at that time. &nbsp;If I had it would have been the&nbsp;Tengen&nbsp;version of&nbsp;Tetris&nbsp;and not the Nintendo one. &nbsp; I understood the rules, I just was proficient, not a great player though. &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Compare this to about 7 -8 years ago when I was training for&nbsp;Gameboy&nbsp;Tetris&nbsp;World record&#8230;..<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I did not score the required amount to go to round 2. &nbsp; That was fine, I could do it again. &nbsp; Unfortunately that was when the Pa wanted to leave bug hit. &nbsp; He&nbsp;was done&nbsp;and&nbsp;bored&nbsp;and ready to go. &nbsp; In his mind I did what I came to do and we could then leave. &nbsp; We couldn&#8217;t wait around to try again. &nbsp; We could not waste hours playing video games. &nbsp; It was time to leave. &nbsp; I may have gotten a reprieve of twenty minutes, but that would have been the most.<\/p>\n<p>I rolled the dice ended up with my grandfather and missed out on advancing in the competition. &nbsp; I did attempt it though. &nbsp; I can also say out of big events in my life it was one of the view my grandfather and I did something. &nbsp; We have gone to car shows and fairs. &nbsp; Those were all things he&nbsp;was interested&nbsp;in though. I can say this is one of the things that I know he did just for me.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now your playing with power. &nbsp; That is what Nintendo was telling us in the late eighties. &nbsp;I was a complete Nintendo boy. &nbsp; I got&nbsp;my first job&nbsp;just to get an NES. &nbsp;Eventually my grandparents &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":91842,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/91840"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=91840"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/91840\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/91842"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=91840"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=91840"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=91840"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
