On a side note, I thought the ad-hoc computer network that said &#8220;Free wireless here&#8221; was cute. Though anyone with half a brain could see it was an ad-hoc network.<\/p>\n<p>Interesting observations on the airport &#8211; I got here at 2 PM &#8211; and my flight departs at 7:05 PM. At the front counter, I tried to get an earlier flight (4:35 flight) but they told me it would cost 25.00 to change flights. Now I&#8217;ve changed flights many times in the past, and there had never been a charge. As long as you are going to the same place an earlier or later flight costs the airline nothing if they are not booked on the flight &#8211; the cost to move the people is the same either way.<\/p>\n<p>So I checked my bags grumbled and complained about the cost but walked away and accepted my normal flight time. When I got inside I explored my terminal (2\/3 in JFK, then went to the gate. I found an information area to see where\u00a0the earlier flight was leaving from. I ventured to that gate and checked and see if I could switch flights. They were more than happy to switch &#8211; AT NO CHARGE. Why 150 feet closer means 25.00 cheaper &#8211; I have no clue. But then the bomb dropped &#8211; since I checked a bag I could not switch flights. ARRGG. Stupid liquid restrictions caused me to check a bag.<\/p>\n<p>So no home earlier for me.<\/p>\n<p>Right now for some reason I&#8217;m sitting on the floor and airport maintenance is measuring around me, I&#8217;m not sure what for, I&#8217;m listening to my MP3 player so I&#8217;m not listening to them, but I was going to move and they told me to stay there that I was fine where I was. They have pulled out measuring tape and it kind of feels like they are measuring my coffin &#8211; albeit a big one since I would guess the size they are measuring is about 10&#215;5 &#8211; and I&#8217;m definitely not that big of a person. So I have 4 people standing less than 3 feet from me = kind of hovering &#8211; kind of disconcerting.<\/p>\n<p>Another irony &#8211; I received a voicemail that I didn&#8217;t check until I was in NYC &#8211; it turns out Sat. night a friend left his cell phone in my car &#8211; so I get to search for it and give it back to him on my way home tonight.<\/p>\n<p>The laptop battery is getting low &#8211; heading out for food and a power plug.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I had to pull out my cellular card since this airport does not have any free wireless access.
