The cars\u2014resembling bobsleds &#8212; operate within a steel trough, on which they are allowed to operate freely. This allows the ride to swing from side to side when turning sharp corners, as an actual bobsled would.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Let&#8217;s head back to the Summer of 1985. &nbsp;We arrived at the park and from the parking lot I could see this marvelous blue ride. &nbsp; Getting into the park, the ride was situated right next to Kid Arthur&#8217;s Court. &nbsp; I would love to say that I rode it immediately, but I don&#8217;t remember. &nbsp; &nbsp;Avalanche Run did flip my world a bit.<\/p>\n<p>My parents always had a system when it came to rides in the park. &nbsp; My dad would always take me on the roller coasters. &nbsp; My mother on the hand would take me on all the spinning rides.<\/p>\n<p>My father as he got older couldn&#8217;t handle the spinning rides at all. &nbsp;Keep in mind that in 1985 he was nine years younger than me. &nbsp; I have inherited his genetic handling of these spinning rides. &nbsp; So while my mother was taking my little brother on the kiddie rides, my dad would take me to wait in the long lines. &nbsp; Besides random camping trips, this was probably the most bonding my father and I had when I was a kid.<\/p>\n<p>My mother never had any interest in roller coasters. &nbsp;What she did was take me on all the spinning rides that my father could not handle. &nbsp; When it came to rides like bumper cars it was a toss-up who take me on. &nbsp; I was also at the tail end of riding the kiddie land rides also. &nbsp; It was a great time to be a kid. &nbsp; I managed to ride all the rides I was tall enough to get on. &nbsp;More rides than either of my parents.<\/p>\n<p>In the strange case of Avalanche Run, I think my father only took me on the ride the very first time. &nbsp; On every subsequent ride, my mother went with me. For some reason, she just loved this coaster. &nbsp; In the following years until I was wandering off by myself my mother always rode this with me. &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#8217;t normally write fondly about my mother, but this was a great time I had with her. Bonding with my mother and bonding with my father &#8211; roller coasters is a great family experience.<\/p>\n<p>Avalanche Run at the time was my second favorite ride. &nbsp;The Gemini will always be my perennial favorite.&nbsp; Its line didn&#8217;t take hours to get through and I could run off and ride it sometimes by myself while my parents were in Kiddie Land. Then in 1990, Disaster Transport was born.<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center>The opening weekend that year I&#8217;m studying the map to find out where this new coaster is. &nbsp; I was confused. &nbsp; It showed that it was right where Avalanche Run was. &nbsp; As we made it to the parking lot I couldn&#8217;t see the familiar blue sight along the beach. &nbsp;It was seeking in. &nbsp; They tore out Avalanche Run and replaced it with something that looked like an industrial building in the distance.<\/p>\n<p>Cedar Point constructed an enclosure to keep the sand and elements off the track. &nbsp; I guess over the four years of Avalanche Run the elements were causing havoc with the track. &nbsp; The solution instead of losing the ride altogether was to build an enclosure around the ride. &nbsp; It has operated this way for the last twenty-two years.<\/p>\n<p>When the enclosure was new they really worked at selling this ride. &nbsp;I&#8217;m assuming the inspiration to go with a science fiction theme was Disney&#8217;s Space Mountain. &nbsp; They embraced the theme completely and delivered an experience unlike you have ever seen since in the park.<\/p>\n<p>The idea behind the theme is that there was that there is a transport line from Cedar Point to Alaska. &nbsp;The slogan is &#8220;We get you there in five minutes or we don&#8217;t get you there at all&#8221;. &nbsp; The queue line was divided into four sections. &nbsp; Every fifteen minutes they would move you to a new room. &nbsp; The side effect of this was a ride that normally had a fifteen-minute wait jumped to a mandatory forty-five minutes.<\/p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t find pictures of all the areas, but I will do my best to go through them one by one. &nbsp; The first room was staged like a boarding area of an airline. &nbsp; There were post-apocalyptic posters up of cities such as New York City and Rome in the entrance walkway. &nbsp; There was a podium where a worker was standing that gave a spiel that described the main walkway was damaged and they would be routing us through to the transport the back way. &nbsp;This room was filled with black lights and in later years they would try to sell you little light-up toys and neon bracelets that would react to the black light.<\/p>\n<p>The next room you went through was the control room. &nbsp;In this room was a video playing describing the operations of the transport. &nbsp; A captain of the ship was giving the presentation. &nbsp; At some point, there was a malfunction, but he played it off.<\/p>\n<p>The third room was the repair room. &nbsp;In this room was a robot that also had a little show involved with it. &nbsp;At some point, the robot started acting strange and this was another sign that things were not always as they seemed. &nbsp;It was all meant to give the impression of a struggling company that was cutting corners.<\/p>\n<p>The last room was the boarding area where you would actually board the ride (today this is the only room that is left). &nbsp; The attendant counted off the people and sent them over to board the ride. &nbsp; Since you couldn&#8217;t line up behind someone for a lane, this meant that it was the hardest one to get either a front or back seat in the park. &nbsp;This room with the stairs going up to it is the only room left in operations today.<\/p>\n<p>The theming did not end there. &nbsp;Going up the hill were strobe lights, fog, and some televisions that essentially were telling you to have a safe trip. &nbsp; Then the TV glitches (<em>on purpose<\/em>) near the top of the hill. &nbsp;This was once again to reinforce the run-down company image.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the ride, you are chased by space pirates that damage your craft. &nbsp;You then are warned you will have to make an emergency landing. &nbsp; You circle some planets and then see the planet earth from above as you orbit it. &nbsp; Then they manage to get control of the ship at the last minute. &nbsp;You then safely make it to the arrival area and leave the ride.<\/p>\n<p>You would think that it sounds really really cool. &nbsp; Not o much. &nbsp;When the ride was full, that forty-five-minute wait wasn&#8217;t too bad. &nbsp;When the park was dead, that wait was excruciating. &nbsp; It was also the hardest line to smoke in&#8230;.not that&#8230;I&#8230;.ever smoked in line&#8230;at Cedar Point&#8230;&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Things also started breaking after a few years. &nbsp;First, they removed the spiel in the first room. &nbsp;Then the video broke in the second room. &nbsp;Then the robot broke. &nbsp; So you are walking through these theme rooms where nothing happens. &nbsp;By this time you could just walk through and not wait in each room.<\/p>\n<p>Then the effects in the ride started breaking. &nbsp;No more TVs. &nbsp;No more videos or voiceovers. &nbsp;No more planet earth. &nbsp;Today you ride it completely in the dark. &nbsp; Cedar Point gave up on the upkeep of this ride about fifteen years ago. &nbsp; They removed the cool factor that made it an experience. &nbsp; All you have literally left is Avalanche Run in the dark. &nbsp; &nbsp;The ride is no longer smooth, just a very very rough ride for something that originally felt like a bobsled.<\/p>\n<p>I wish I could truly say I will miss the ride. &nbsp; What I miss is riding Avalanche Run with my mother. &nbsp; That experience was gone twenty-three years ago. &nbsp;So while this was a bittersweet loss, I can say I was first angry when Disaster Transport showed up (especially after sitting in each room for fifteen minutes for the third or fourth time).<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center><center><\/center><\/p>\n<p><center><\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The summer of 1985 was great. &nbsp;Getting ready for the annual trip to Cedar Point was one of the highlights until we moved closer and got Season Passes. &nbsp;
