I finished the first one a few years ago, and while I&#8217;ve chomped at the bit to play this one, I held off. I was under the impression that I was going t finish that horrendous GBA card game version (which I bought when it was originally released). I however couldn&#8217;t stand the card game play, to those that enjoy that type of game, more power to you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kingdom Hearts 2 was as good as the original one, an engaging and interesting story. My only issue is that the game is essentially a button masher. Very little strategy or difficulty on normal, and I&#8217;m in the vein that a game shouldn&#8217;t be on hard just to have a challenge, so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll go back any time soon and play it on difficult just to get an elusive challenge. I didn&#8217;t &#8220;die&#8221; until the world, I my most used summons was chicken little and I only summoned him 4 times, I finished 84% of Jimminy&#8217;s Journal, my most used form was Valor which I used 24 times, and I healed my companions 21 times. The game took me about 36-37 hours, I think this game will go down as one of the classics for me. This game while a button a masher has some of hte best controls I&#8217;ve run across in a video game in a long time. If you haven&#8217;t played I highly recommend it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Opening Cinematics<\/p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"src\" value=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/RNAwNhlcYN4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" \/><embed type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/RNAwNhlcYN4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/embed><\/object><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Purchase it at Amazon I know, I&#8217;m a little bit behind the times finishing Kingdom Hearts 2 today.
