I logged in tonight and hunted down some old friends to add, but this is a once-in-a-great-while occasion. I usually avoid MySpace like the plague unless I get a message that someone left a comment, friend request (usually spam using the same profile different pic), or mail.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why with all the crappy errors you get moving around your own home page behind the scenes (mail, comments, etc) where a random HTML error pops up. The site for the most part (displaying to the user section) is so simple I have to go with the fact that it must be their scalability.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the last thing I hate about MySpace is that everyone&#8217;s profile (mine included since you can&#8217;t really do too much with it) looks like bad web pages from 1994. I have to browse MySpace with my speakers muted since I have never been able to stand music embedded in a web page. I guess you can blame that on too many people putting midi in their web pages back in the mid-&#8217;90s.<\/p>\n<p>I have been an Internet user for almost 13 years now &#8211; and MySpace has been the biggest decline for the most part in aesthetic design since the lynx stopped being the dominant web browser.<\/p>\n<p>I can sum most of it up in five words:<\/p>\n<p>I just don&#8217;t get it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don&#8217;t get MySpace addiction among so many people.
