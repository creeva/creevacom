This is the first part of my kiosk series which is going to examine the testing and deployment of such a system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Kiosk Options<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When discussing the kiosk system we need to discuss the scope, security issues, and functionality requirements that we must maintain to achieve a successful deployment. There are many types of kiosk systems that we can implement within the Company network. The solutions we are going to describe in this document are based on product literature that we have received after the scope is finalized actual product testing will be done so we can verify that all the features work as described and will function within the deployed environment.<\/p>\n<p>For the sake of categorization, the following options were identified as possible for use within a kiosk environment. This list is not meant to be all-encompassing but rather a list of desired features that we feel can be accomplished from the products we are looking at.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Internal Websites \u2013 company Designated<br \/>\n\u00b7 External Websites \u2013 Completely open from a kiosk standpoint<br \/>\n\u00b7 SSL VPN \u2013 For access to the internal network<br \/>\n\u00b7 Citrix \u2013 for terminal server capabilities<br \/>\n\u00b7 Printing \u2013 locally attached print<br \/>\n\u00b7 Sound \u2013 for hearing active embedded media<br \/>\n\u00b7 USB Mounting \u2013 for USB memory sticks<br \/>\n\u00b7 Run Apps Locally (Read Only) \u2013 from either the memory stick or kiosk directly<br \/>\n\u00b7 Run Apps Locally (Read \/ Write) \u2013 from either the memory stick or kiosk directly<br \/>\n\u00b7 Write to USB Memory Stick \u2013 from the kiosk<br \/>\n\u00b7 Access to User Documents<br \/>\n\u00b7 No Login \u2013 completely is designed to start being used without login<br \/>\n\u00b7 Boiler Plate Website \u2013 standard start page<br \/>\n\u00b7 Full application list<br \/>\n\u00b7 Internal \u2013 Authentication<br \/>\n\u00b7 External &#8211; No Authentication<br \/>\n\u00b7 Browser Plug-ins \u2013 for enhanced compatibility<br \/>\n\u00b7 Restricted To Certain Web Sites \u2013 Company Designated<\/p>\n<p>Kiosk mode systems come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and functions. To help narrow the design gap for our needs we have devised eight categories in which we can work around design structures for:<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Full web-only access kiosk on the company guest network<br \/>\n\u00b7 Limited web access on the company guest network with a locked-down browser<br \/>\n\u00b7 Full web-only access kiosk on the internal network<br \/>\n\u00b7 Limited web access on the internal network with a locked-down browser<br \/>\n\u00b7 Limited seats with security controls on the company guest network<br \/>\n\u00b7 Limited seat with security controls on the internal network<br \/>\n\u00b7 Full seat with security controls on the company guest network<br \/>\n\u00b7 Full seat open use office solution &#8211; internal network<br \/>\n\u00b7 Full seat with security Controls open use office on the internal network<\/p>\n<p>Each solution has its own benefits and concerns for deployment. We will be going over these one by one to analyze and work with the company to implement the correct and desired solution. The analysis will include which functions identified above can be implemented, target placement, target users, benefits and disadvantages of each solution, and possible security concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Full web-only access kiosk on the company guest network:<\/p>\n<p>Description: This would be a fully open web kiosk with an address bar located at the top with the web browser being the only application available to the end user.
