examine the testing and deployment of such a system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Kiosk Options<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When discussing the kiosk system we need to discuss the scope, security issues, and functionality requirements that we must maintain to achieve a successful deployment.\u00a0\u00a0 There are many types of kiosk systems that we can implement within the Company network.\u00a0\u00a0 The solutions we are going to describe in this document are based on product literature that we have received after the scope is finalized actual product testing will be done so we can verify that all the features work as described and will function within the deployed environment.<\/p>\n<p>For the sake of categorization, the following options were identified as possible for use within a kiosk environment.\u00a0\u00a0 This list is not meant to be all-encompassing but rather a list of desired features that we feel can be accomplished from the products we are looking

placement, target users, benefits and disadvantages of each solution, and possible security concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Full web-only access kiosk on the company guest network:<\/p>\n<p>Description: This would
