I was originally going to relate the story of my mother and the cedar chest, but I already did that. If you missed it, here it is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I will now give you an example I have full memory and first hand knowledge of. It was at a family holiday dinner a few years ago at my grandparents and somehow the morbid subject of what we would like if my grandparents passed on. I stated I would only want one thing, a cedar chest crafted by my grandmother&#8217;s cousin. My grandmother chimed in that it was going to be given to her cousin&#8217;s family, well my grandmother has said that my whole life, so for thirty years it&#8217;s still been sitting there. My mother then said I couldn&#8217;t have it because she wanted it. Selfish? Well let&#8217;s continue this story.<br \/>\nA few minutes later my mother asked me why I wanted the chest because she thought it was ugly and tacky. I said it was something that would always remind me of my grandparents, their house, and the memories. To me the chest is kind of like a symbol of my grandparents. This prompted me though to ask why did she want it if it was ugly? Her answer? She said she wanted it because I said I wanted it. So I was shocked and called her selfish, I think that was my annual fight that year and I left. It was petty, you would think as adamant as she was when she said she wanted it, that somehow I knew there was a secret stash of money tucked away in it. Nope, she is just worried about someone else getting something she can&#8217;t. What a great mother.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ll get re-organized through my drafts and getting something new up tomorrow. Even writing about her is aggravating and putting me all out of sorts.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/01\/a-month-of-mom-part-1-the-background\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 1 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/02\/a-month-of-mom-part-2-the-end-is-the-beginning\/ \" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 2 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/month-of-mom-part-3-back-in-ohio\/ \" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 3 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/04\/month-of-mom-part-4-still-in-ohio\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 4 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/05\/a-month-with-mom-part-5-you-cant-help-those-that-dont-help-themselves\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 5 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/06\/a-month-with-mom-part-6-shop-a-holic\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 6 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/07\/a-month-with-mom-part-7-respect-is-a-two-way-street\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 7 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/08\/a-month-with-mom-part-8-in-oregon\/ \" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 8 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/09\/a-month-with-mom-part-9-favortism\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 9 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-10-do-these-curtains-make-me-look-fat\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 10 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/11\/a-month-with-mom-part-11-keeping-up-with-the-jones\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 11 here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-12-gossip-girl\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 12 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-13-talking-behind-the-back\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 13 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-14-father-issues\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 14 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-15-if-you-have-it-im-entitled-also\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 15 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-16-dealing-with-the-ex\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 16 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-17-dating-a-girl-just-like-mom\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 17 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-18-my-mother-issues\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 18 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/19\/a-month-with-mom-part-19-my-sisters-view\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 19 Here<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My sister&#8217;s email I published yesterday has my stories out of whack now.
