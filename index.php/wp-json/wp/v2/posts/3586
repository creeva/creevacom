It was at a family holiday dinner a few years ago at my grandparents and somehow the morbid subject of what we would like if my grandparents passed on. I stated I would only want one thing, a cedar chest crafted by my grandmother&#8217;s cousin. My grandmother chimed in that it was going to be given to her cousin&#8217;s family, well my grandmother has said that my whole life, so for thirty years it&#8217;s still been sitting there. My mother then said I couldn&#8217;t have it because she wanted it. Selfish? Well let&#8217;s continue this story.<br \/>\nA few minutes later my mother asked me why I wanted the chest because she thought it was ugly and tacky. I said it was something that would always remind me of my grandparents, their house, and the memories. To me the chest is kind of like a symbol of my grandparents. This prompted me though to ask why did she want it if it was ugly? Her answer? She said she wanted it because I said I wanted it. So I was shocked and called her selfish, I think that was my annual fight that year and I left. It was petty, you would think as adamant as she was when she said she wanted it, that somehow I knew there was a secret stash of money tucked away in it. Nope, she is just worried about someone else getting something she can&#8217;t. What a great mother.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ll get re-organized through my drafts and getting something new up tomorrow.\u00a0 Even writing about her is aggravating and putting me all out of sorts.<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 2 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 3 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 4 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 5 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 6 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 7 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 8 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 9 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 10 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 11 here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 12 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 13 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 14 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 15 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 16 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 17 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 18 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 19 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My sister&#8217;s email I published yesterday has my stories out of whack now.\u00a0\u00a0 I was originally going to relate the story of my mother and the cedar chest, but I already did that.\u00a0\u00a0 If you &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3586"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3586"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3586\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3586"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3586"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3586"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
