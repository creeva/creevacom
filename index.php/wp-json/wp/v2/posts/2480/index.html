Off in the distance a female was conjuring magic out of the dust for her own amusement. She was dressed in a dark purple robe with the symbol of the local church centered within the area covering the small of her back. Her long black hair streamed over her shoulders, barely hiding the pale skin on her neck and the half-elven ears on her head. She turns and sees me watching her. I freeze.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDo you enjoy watching maidens when they assume that they are alone,\u201d she speaks in a tone that froze my blood so cold that I was afraid an icicle would penetrate my heart.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo\u2026uh..I..,\u201d I stammered.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOut with it you stupid fool, I do not have time for incompetence from beings that are intellectually beneath me stammering about. Do you wish to say something in your defense?\u201d She says as she glares into my soul. I feel a wetness coming from the crotch of my trousers, for a second I thought the lady had cut me, until the pungent smell of urine hits my nostrils. Before I could get myself in any more trouble I run away.<\/p>\n<p>I run for what seems to be an eternity but I finally make it back to the town I was staying in, beautiful and safe Mizraith. I take a look at the prize, the reason I am here, a huge 20-pound diamond that sits upon the steeple of the Nogod temple. If I manage to swipe that gem I will be set for life. I might even manage to leverage the cash and become the richest man in the country. Then the king will ask to borrow money from me; of course I would lend it to him, with interest of course. The sun is beginning to set<\/p>\n<p>and my tastes buds are yearning for a taste of ale. I head to the Cramped Pigeon in and set myself upon a bar stool preparing for a long night.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat ale\u2019s ya,\u201dasks the bartender, a gruff figure of a dwarf<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAle\u2019s ya\u2026I love that one Crom\u2026every time I love that. What ale\u2019s ya\u201d says a drunken halfling down the bar.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNever mind Creve,\u201d Crom says. \u201cWhat can I get for you tonight Mikel?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCrom my dear man, I think I am in love. Today in the forest I saw the most beautiful creature wandering. She was also one of the rudest characters I have met in my travels.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDo you know if this lass of yours is a local?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI would assume so, she had the mark of the Nogod temple upon her robe, tell me Crom&#8212;Are the priestesses of Nogod allowed to wed?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMikel, my lucky bastard of a guest, they are allowed to marry, frolic, and have children. There is actually pretty little outlawed by the religion. So tell me what did the vision that you would want to warm your bed look like. Quite a few of the priestesses come in here time to time. Perhaps I could arrange an introduction for you, the cost will only be naming your first born after me,\u201d he says with a jovial smile.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe was a half-elf, with black hair wearing a purple robe with eyes the color of\u2026.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe color of the greenest grass,\u201d Crom says cutting me off with a scared look crossing into his eyes. \u201cor the color of the truest goblin blood.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever do you mean?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI mean that you should give up this girl and leave town immediately,\u201d he states as the color starts to drain from his face. \u201cFor your own good forget the girl and put her into your past.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhy, who is this woman\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHer name is Bethany Stronstrom, High Priestess of Nogod, and Protector of Mizraith.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBethany Stronstrom, as in the town ruler of this city?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne and the same.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhy should I be afraid, is she this cruel and unjust tyrant who kills men who so much as look in her direction?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot quite, actually she is one of the least strict rulers in the land, she travels quite often and leaves a priest by the name of Tomas in charge, a friendly sort of bloke.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThen why should I just walk away?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFirst off, any man who has tried to court has always mysteriously disappeared. Secondly, she is devoted to her beliefs and if you do not think like her she believes you are beneath her. She has no friends within the city walls save one, a dwarf by the name of Quinn. I have even heard that good nature fellow say a few harsh words about her. The only other people close to her live in Thornwood Keep, which is about a two-week ride away. For your own safety and sanity you should just forget about her.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy dear men, the Gods have stricken my heart with a disease that has no cure. I swear by it now I will leave this town with my beauty,\u201d referring to Bethany and the diamond.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI hope you have led a fulfilling life Mikel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The dawn creeps into my room like an unwanted visitor. I try to cover my head with a thin sheet, but the light pierces through my flimsy shield. As I open my eyes and can see diamond from here. I purposely chose this room just for that purpose, so every morning in which I have been lax the night before, I would be tortured by the site of the diamond shining down in all of its glory. I close the window shutters and go back to sleep.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s been about two hours since my battle with dawn and I am finally preparing myself to go out and embrace the day. I head downstairs to the tavern and order two eggs over easy from the waitress. Then I sit back and rest my eyes, which are still in their early morning drowsy state. Something clatters down on the table in front of me as I notice that I have drowsed off. Barely opening my eyes I look down to where the noise had come from, my eggs, here are my beautiful eggs. It might just be a good morning after all.<\/p>\n<p>After finishing my wonderful breakfast, I drop my gold piece down and head out and around the town. It is time start asking around town about this \u201cQuinn\u201d fellow that Bethany is friends with. I notice a dwarven shop keeper selling candles scented with fragrant oils and decided that he was as good a place as any to start.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cExcuse me, Merchant\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYes, young sir?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a dwarf by the name of Quinn, friend of Bethany Stronstrom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cQuinn, is quite easy to find, head down to the Guard Master Station, ask to speak to the City\u2019s Chief Constable of Mizraith and they\u2019ll fix you right up\u2026\u2026now that will be 5 gold pieces.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFive gold pieces for what?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell by seeing the way you jaw dropped, it\u2019ll be 5 gold pieces to keep my mouth shut. Trust me, I know the look of dishonesty anywhere and I know your around here to only cause a trouble, I\u2019m just offering to help you cover your own tracks.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHardly, go about your business merchant\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOk, but when you see Quinn, tell him that his godson Sarif Maxim said hi.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I walk quietly away five gold pieces poorer than I was ten minutes ago with nothing but a couple copper\u2019s worth of candles to show for it. Damn cheating dwarf, I\u2019ll have my revenge on him yet. Godfather Quinn\u2026.that knowledge might be worth the 5 gold pieces itself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is a short story I started but never finished The air was crisp and fevered, a very high temperature for a late fall day.
