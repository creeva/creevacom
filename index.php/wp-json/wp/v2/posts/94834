They have been placed in guide levels. \u00a0 I&#8217;ll be honest, these levels might have been in place previously. \u00a0I hadn&#8217;t heard of the service until this week. \u00a0 However, the rewards are new. \u00a0 The rewards are based on your level tiers.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Level 1 &#8211; (0 &#8211; 4 points) allows users to enter exclusive contests in select countries<\/li>\n<li>Level 2 &#8211; (5 &#8211; 49 points) provides early access to new Google products and features.<\/li>\n<li>Level 3 &#8211; (50 &#8211; 199 points) allows a user to show up in the Google Maps app with an official Local Guides badge.<\/li>\n<li>Level 4 &#8211; (200 &#8211; 499 points) offers a free 1 TB upgrade of the user&#8217;s Drive storage.<\/li>\n<li>Level 5 &#8211; (500+ points) allows reviewers to become eligible to apply to attend the company&#8217;s inaugural summit in 2016. (Details will be released next year.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>How To Earn Local Guide Points<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/local-guides\/answer\/6225851?hl=en\">Google wrote up a help page about how to earn points<\/a>. I&#8217;ll give you a quick rundown. \u00a0 The first thing you need to do is look up the business in Google Maps. \u00a0 From there you can rate and review a restaurant. \u00a0This gives you 1 point. \u00a0 If you are on a mobile app it will ask you additional questions such as &#8220;Do They Offer Take Out&#8221; or &#8220;Is This Place Cash Only&#8221;. \u00a0 This takes about 10 seconds and gives you a second point. \u00a0 If you add a picture, that gains you a point. \u00a0 If you correct details such as hours &#8211; that gives you a point.<\/p>\n<p>You can take a picture of a business without rating it. \u00a0 You can not do the questions without first providing a rating.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are Points Only Gained From Places I&#8217;m Local To?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the things they ask you when you first sign up is they ask for your zip code. \u00a0 I was curious if it would allow me to review places a few states away (currently I&#8217;m on travel this week). \u00a0 \u00a0It does and those points forward towards your count. \u00a0 Anywhere you know well enough to review you can go back and place in the review. \u00a0 In theory, you could put in places you haven&#8217;t been &#8211; but be fair and make the system work accurately.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Is The Downside?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All images and reviews you submit are available for public view. \u00a0 The images do show up on your Google Plus page as public, but you can modify your security to hide this tab. \u00a0This may or may not be a security concern for you. \u00a0After you reach the top level you are shooting for you can then leave the local guide program. \u00a0 At this point, you are supposed to be able to remove all of your information. \u00a0 How true this is, I can&#8217;t answer. \u00a0 I did want to point out the issue though. \u00a0 Google also hasn&#8217;t stated if you will lose the terabyte space increase if you leave the program. \u00a0 To that end, they haven&#8217;t stated if this will be a yearly item you will need to achieve to maintain it or if it&#8217;s a one-time for-life item. \u00a0These are some unanswered questions that you may want to consider.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Verifying Your Points<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To verify how many points you have earned, you need to use the mobile app. \u00a0 I haven&#8217;t seen any quick method to see this on the standard website. \u00a0 In the app click the three lines next to the search bar. \u00a0This will open a side screen that lets you select your contributions. \u00a0 At the top will be your level and how many points you have. \u00a0 You can click the points bar and it will break down where you received points from (reviews, photos, answers, added places, and edited places). \u00a0 At the bottom you have a todo section (mine is blank) this recommends places for you to try out. \u00a0 There are two more tabs on the bottom you can switch to. \u00a0 The first is the Reviews tab, which lists all the reviews you have added to the program. \u00a0The second is the Photos tab which shows all the photos you have contributed and lists have many people have seen them.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of this week, I should already be level 5. \u00a0 I&#8217;ve been reviewing and uploading pictures in my spare time. \u00a0 The points rack up quickly. \u00a0The only annoyance is that it takes about a day to post, so you can&#8217;t watch the points go up automatically as you do things. \u00a0 This is interesting for all those who are always wanting more cloud space. \u00a0 It also helps the community by improving search results down to a local level.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is a Local Guide I know reading the headline, some of you are wondering what the heck is a Google Local Guide. \u00a0This is actually a service that has existed for a while in &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94835,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94834"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=94834"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94834\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94835"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=94834"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=94834"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=94834"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
