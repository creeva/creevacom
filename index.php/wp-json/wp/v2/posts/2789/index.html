I had some specific goals in mind and I can&#8217;t say I really accomplished them.<\/p>\n<p>The first goal I had was to attempt to upload pictures directly to Flickr. Doing some hunting I found the latest revision of <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/altcanvas\/\">maemo-publishr<\/a> which supports uploading to Flickr and to Picasa. I thought great, this is exactly what I need.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I can say that it didn&#8217;t work as well as I had hoped. The applications were extremely slow before i imported pictures from my external memory card and worse after pictures were actually involved. I gave up on the application after failing to figure out how to intuitively upload (no I didn&#8217;t watch the video at that time, I saw it afterward to share with you). I know maemo-wordpy can upload to flickr and I am using that, but I want something that handles more bulk uploading so the hunt for that continues.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before I get onto my next bad experience, let&#8217;s move on to a good one. Using my N810 as my lifeline to my online life, I needed it to integrate with my other online lifeline, email. After going through and reading reviews I knew better than to use the built-in e-mail application. I knew that if I wanted to use IMAP from my Gmail account I had a choice between <a href=\"http:\/\/modest.garage.maemo.org\/\">Modest<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.claws-mail.org\/maemo\/\">Claws Mail<\/a>. Xie had tried out Modest on her N810 when it came in, it had caused memory issues and she stopped using it and doesn&#8217;t plan on doing IMAP. I knew because of that Modest was out.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So Claws Mail it was, after a couple of configurations I did get Claws up and working. It is a bit slow, but I knew that going in, especially using IMAP. At least I can cache my email instead of holding my full 2 GB e-mail archive on my N810. Sending is fine. Overall as an e-mail application, I&#8217;m quite happy with it. That&#8217;s pretty impressive since the only other e-mail applications I&#8217;m really happy with are Outlook and the Gmail web interface.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.claws-mail.org\/maemo\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/05\/claws-maemo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Claws-Mail screenshot from their website<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now we&#8217;re back to one of the issues I wrote about yesterday, podcatching. I found out that while I couldn&#8217;t activate the function menu in Canola I could manually hold down the function key and hit the key I wanted at the same time (shift works the same way for these poorly written applications). With this method, I could enter my podcasts feed and download them directly onto my N810 &#8211; goodbye slow memory hog gPodder. At this point, I uninstalled gPodder and decide that Canola was going to be my choice going forward.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I played more with Canola and I wasn&#8217;t aware of the kinetic scrolling. I sat there like a monkey with the stylus trying to scroll and was extremely frustrated. I finally figured it out. I exited it and rebooted after a different application seemed to lock up my N810 &#8211; I think it was the maemo-publishr previously mentioned. When I came back Canola started and said loading for like 3 minutes and when it did load no icons were visible and it couldn&#8217;t do anything. I uninstalled Canola and reinstalled Canola, same behavior. From their repository, I saw an installation clean-up utility. I installed that and it did clean it up. I reinstalled it and it&#8217;s working again. Unfortunately, I need to spend 30 minutes again entering in all of my podcast URLs, grrrrrrrrrrr. The benefit is that Canola can automatically scrobble to last.fm with a plugin. The plugin is a bit anticipating though, it scrobbled two podcasts that I haven&#8217;t listened to yet. I have a feeling Canola is going to be a love\/hate relationship.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, I rounded out the night loading <a href=\"http:\/\/maemo.org\/downloads\/product\/OS2007\/doom\/\">Doom on my N810.<\/a> I was surprised that we don&#8217;t need to load wad files for these cross-platform ports, and the game controlled a little bit Metroid Prime-ish, but it&#8217;s Doom and it works. Ironically it works better than it did on the 386 25mhz computer that I first played doom on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last night was more of a bust than a boom for me.
