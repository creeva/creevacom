goodbye slow memory hog gPodder.\u00a0\u00a0 At this point, I uninstalled gPodder and decide that Canola was going to be my choice going forward.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I played more with Canola and I wasn&#8217;t aware of the kinetic scrolling.\u00a0 I sat there like a monkey with the stylus trying to scroll and was extremely frustrated.\u00a0 I finally figured it out.\u00a0\u00a0 I exited it and rebooted after a different application seemed to lock up my N810 &#8211; I think it was the maemo-publishr previously mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0 When I came back Canola started and said loading for like 3 minutes and when it did load no icons were visible and it couldn&#8217;t do anything.\u00a0\u00a0 I uninstalled Canola and reinstalled Canola, same behavior.\u00a0\u00a0 From their repository, I saw an installation clean-up utility.\u00a0 I installed that and it did clean it up.\u00a0 I reinstalled it and it&#8217;s working again.\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, I need to spend 30 minutes again entering in all of my podcast URLs, grrrrrrrrrrr.\u00a0\u00a0 The benefit is that Canola can automatically scrobble to last.fm with a plugin.\u00a0\u00a0 The plugin is a bit anticipating though, it scrobbled two podcasts that I haven&#8217;t listened to yet.\u00a0\u00a0 I have a feeling Canola is going to be a love\/hate relationship.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Finally, I rounded out the night loading <a href=\"http:\/\/maemo.org\/downloads\/product\/OS2007\/doom\/\">Doom on my N810.<\/a> I was surprised that we don&#8217;t need to load wad files for these cross-platform ports, and the game controlled a little bit Metroid Prime-ish, but it&#8217;s Doom and it works.\u00a0\u00a0 Ironically it works better than it did on the 386 25mhz computer that I first played doom on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last night was more of a bust than a boom for me.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had some specific goals in mind and I can&#8217;t say I really accomplished them.
