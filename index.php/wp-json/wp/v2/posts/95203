I&#8217;ll never get back to that again. \u00a0 We will get to the why in a moment.<\/p>\n<p><em>Baseball Stars<\/em> (<a href=\"http:\/\/duesr.com\/index.php\/2017\/02\/27\/retrometrics-popeye-nes\/\">like yesterday&#8217;s piece on Popeye<\/a>) started out as an arcade cabinet. \u00a0This is where things get a little weird though. \u00a0 I can find YouTube footage of Baseball Stars Professional and Baseball Stars 2 in their arcade incarnations, but not the original. \u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baseball_Stars\">Wikipedia confirms that it started as an arcade before going to the NES though<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this weird? \u00a0Well no matter how obscure an arcade or console game, I&#8217;ve never been unsuccessful at finding footage. \u00a0I can&#8217;t even find pictures of the arcade cabinet. \u00a0 If I was a little more ambitious I would search if it is available with MAME and try to get footage. \u00a0I&#8217;m guessing though if I started down that path it would be one of the titles that aren&#8217;t emulated. \u00a0This must mean that it is obscure as Donkey Kong and not nearly as successful as Popeye was (<a href=\"http:\/\/duesr.com\/index.php\/2017\/02\/27\/retrometrics-popeye-nes\/\">read my Popeye piece to understand<\/a>). \u00a0 It was developed by SNK and to be fair for the NES it was considered a hit game.<\/p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t a huge sports game person. \u00a0 \u00a0Today, every few years I will purchase a year or two old copies of some sports titles for 3.99, but you will never see me paying full price for Madden. \u00a0 So when it comes to baseball games on the NES &#8211; I thought that <em>Bases Loaded<\/em> was the standard that everything else should be judged by. \u00a0 Granted I was a fan of <em>Baseball Simulator 1.000<\/em> for its wacky gameplay and <em>Base Wars<\/em> since the robots would fight &#8211; but I wasn&#8217;t an aficionado of the genre by any means.<\/p>\n<p><center><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-95205\"

did was to allow you to create players and teams. \u00a0 Back then you had a limited amount of archetypes you could use, but now I see the footage of people scanning their own faces and putting them on the game characters for modern consoles. \u00a0 When you won games you had the option of upgrading attributes on your players. \u00a0 This allowed there to be an RPG element. \u00a0As you progressed through the season, you leveled up and then destroyed the competition. \u00a0Maybe they should add a baseball stage to the next Final Fantasy title.<\/p>\n<p><center><img decoding=\"async\"
