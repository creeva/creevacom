I don&#8217;t really remember betting money, but if we were annoyed at someone we would take it on them during the game. \u00a0 This taught me to be heavily invested in my game strategy. \u00a0It has followed me ever since.<\/p>\n<p>Before I get into Axis and Allies, I should probably explain the game. \u00a0 It is like Risk, if Risk magically turned into chess on meth. \u00a0 Instead of a standard army unit, you could have nine different unit types encompassing ground troops, an air force, and a navy. \u00a0The land is all divided differently than Risk. \u00a0It is however all about world domination using World War II as the backdrop.<\/p>\n<p>I was introduced to this game around when I was nineteen. \u00a0 My friend Kenn introduced it to our gaming group. \u00a0Some of us loved it. \u00a0 Other people of\u00a0the\u00a0group ending up loathing it. \u00a0 Kenn normally won the games, at first. \u00a0 Some of us were so\u00a0obsessed\u00a0with the game that Kenn took a full sheet of plywood and made an enlarged game board out of it. \u00a0It was self-painted and covered the dining room table perfectly.<\/p>\n<p>Once we were all getting better, the length of the game extended. \u00a0 The longest game I ever saw to completion was over twenty-hours. \u00a0 I have had friends play a single game for days on end. \u00a0 There are many small nuances you need to understand to become a master of the game.<\/p>\n<p>There is one story that loved to be bandied about where my brother beat me in the first time he ever played. \u00a0 Kenn was &#8220;advising&#8221; my brother through out the game. \u00a0 I also wasn&#8217;t taking the game to serious, since I was playing against someone who never played before. \u00a0 I left myself open in a method I never would have to an experienced player. \u00a0Kenn more or less told my brother where to move to expose a weakness. \u00a0 My brother was extremely lucky with the dice and wiped me out. \u00a0 There was some cleanup after that, but in that singular move the game was won. \u00a0 I lost to Kenn playing strategy and my brother throwing the dice.<\/p>\n<p>The real problem is everyone that didn&#8217;t enjoy playing\u00a0was driven away. \u00a0They might come over and hook up a Playstation, but wouldn&#8217;t get involved in Axis and Allies. \u00a0 It got to the point when people showed up over at Kenn&#8217;s house they asked what game was being played that night. \u00a0 Upon hearing the answer the decision would be made whether they were going to stay or not. \u00a0 This fragmented our gaming group a bit. \u00a0Xie also wasn&#8217;t a fan of the game.<\/p>\n<p>Once I moved to Oregon I didn&#8217;t have anyone to play the game with. \u00a0 I stopped for a while. \u00a0Then a version came out for the computer. \u00a0 I was excited that I would finally be able to play again. \u00a0I started a game on easy, and trounced it no problems. \u00a0 I then tried it on hard, it didn&#8217;t seem any harder than easy. \u00a0I was disappointed. \u00a0 I could beat the computer model blindfolded, drunk, and passed out. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t any fun.<\/p>\n<p>I found a version later on for Palm OS. \u00a0It was a clone and not an official version. \u00a0I loved this while traveling, and was actually more difficult than the PC version. \u00a0 Somewhere along the line I lost it, then I moved away from Palm OS. \u00a0I keep looking for a version for the iPhone or the iPad. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t know why it hasn&#8217;t happened. \u00a0 I think the game creators believe that people won&#8217;t pay sixty dollars for the board game.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never owned a copy\u00a0of the board game. \u00a0 It&#8217;s going on at least six or seven years since I&#8217;ve actually played. \u00a0 I&#8217;m rusty as anything and at the moment I don&#8217;t have any wish to really sharpen those skills. \u00a0 In four or five years, when my son is in prime board game age, it&#8217;s on. \u00a0 Even if he doesn&#8217;t really take to it, it is one of the best introductions to strategy that I can teach him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from Wikipedia I&#8217;ll admit it. \u00a0I&#8217;m a recovered Axis and Allies addict. \u00a0 It&#8217;s part of the reason I will not touch Settlers of Catan with a ten foot pole. \u00a0Any strategy game I&#8217;ve &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93490,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/92845"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=92845"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/92845\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93490"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=92845"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=92845"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=92845"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
