If however there was no one to gossip with she would pack up and either take my sisters home, or get someone else to watch them. I&#8217;m sure my mother misses the hey day of the beauty parlor where all the women sat around and gossiped. I&#8217;m sure in some areas these still exist, but not really in her neck of the woods. Besides she felt superior becuase she had &#8220;her&#8221; beautician that she went to. <\/p>\n<p>Her beautician always made sure that her hair came out with that blond color that she was born with. All those pictures I&#8217;ve posted of her as a toddler on up that have dark hair? Well I guess my mother believes that those are all bad exposures since she swears the blond she has now is her natural color. Ironically it&#8217;s because of her and the lies about her hair color that I refuse to ever dye my hair to hide my gray. I&#8217;m not going to tell people my hair is a certain way. Granted I&#8217;ve dyed my hair black for a costume, I&#8217;ve also done purple and blue &#8211; heaven help those that thought those colors were natural. I actually have my mother&#8217;s native hair color, I&#8217;m just not in denial. <\/p>\n<p>My mother would love to gossip. She would spend hours on the phone talking to friends about who was having marriage issues, who was having works issue, who bought something new, and who was stuck with something old. If she didn&#8217;t have any friends at a given time she would either try to get me involved (I never had an interest so I&#8217;m sure she bored of me) or she would enlist my grandmother (who had the same enthusiasm as I did). <\/p>\n<p>You would think she would like to discuss something of interest, but the most poignant she ever got to real life events was what new Longaberger baskets were coming out or discussions about Dr. Phil and Oprah &#8211; it seems to her these are the messiahs of the new world order.
