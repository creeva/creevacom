I managed to get them when there was still thirteen minutes left on the pre-sales. \u00a0 I lucked out on that. \u00a0 Just in case we took a change a clothes. \u00a0 Normally when we go to a concert, I&#8217;m the one that leaves sober at the end of the night before we do the drive home. \u00a0While we have had longer drives to go see shows, this time we were going to see if there was hotel&#8217;s nearby and just do the Uber thing.<\/p>\n<p>The closest town with lodging is Cranberry, PA. \u00a0At first we pulled into a Red Roof in. \u00a0This place looked like it hadn&#8217;t been updated since the late 70&#8217;s or early 80&#8217;s. \u00a0 I took a pass on that one. \u00a0 Then we went over and looked at the Holiday Inn Express. \u00a0It looked bearable so I went in to inquire about a room. \u00a0 The front desk was busy with someone else for a few minutes, so I decided to step outside and take a look on Expedia. \u00a0 There was a Candlewood Suites across the street that was 20.00 cheaper a night than Holiday Inn (and only 17.00 more than the previously mentioned Red Roof Inn). \u00a0 I immediately pre-paid for the room and went across the street. \u00a0 We checked in, but we still had an hour before the doors opened at the show.<\/p>\n<p>Since we knew that it would be an evening of imbibing we decided to get some food in our stomachs. \u00a0 There was a shopping center about a 100 yards away &#8211; so we wandered over to see what was on the menu. \u00a0Chipotle seemed to heavy to us, so we decided on to try Italian Village Pizza. \u00a0 The cheese was good. \u00a0The sauce was interesting. \u00a0I was not a fan of the crust though. \u00a0 We went back to gather our stuff at the hotel and ordered the Uber. \u00a0It was Xie&#8217;s first experience &#8211; thankfully it went painlessly.<\/p>\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve given you an overly long intro &#8211; let&#8217;s move to the sections that actually made you come and read this story&#8230;..<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-95128\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/madvikingcleanblackteepng-1-277x300.png\" alt=\"madvikingcleanblackteepng\" width=\"277\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/madvikingcleanblackteepng-1-277x300.png 277w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/madvikingcleanblackteepng-1.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We arrived and it was a small venue. \u00a0 Not the smallest we have been to, but small.
