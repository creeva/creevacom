I ended up walking out with seasons 1-3 of Star Wars: The Clone Wars on Blu-Ray and some other things. I knew season 4 was out and wanted to pick that up also, so I went to Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>Season 3 I purchased used for $30.00. Season 4 I purchased new for 32.00. If I had known the difference would have been that close I wouldn&#8217;t have purchased it used. We have known for a while that Amazon is hurting traditional brick and mortar stores. Wal-Mart can&#8217;t match the margins that Amazon is working from. Normally though I would get a movie much cheaper at the used store than Wal-Mart. You do run into the instant gratification tax though.<\/p>\n<p>I received the instant gratification of having the seasons in my hand on Sunday. I haven&#8217;t watched them yet, but I have them. When I get home tomorrow season 4 will be waiting for me. From a usage stand point I gained nothing by buying it from the used store. I could have gotten it cheaper on Amazon. That I find crazy.<\/p>\n<p>The used store should sell\u00a0significantly below the new Amazon price. When they take merchandise into the store, just offer the seller a lower amount than they did in the past. These good are almost ephemeral now. So many people are watching movies via streaming or music via MP3 &#8211; physical copies aren&#8217;t worth what they once were. I&#8217;m not saying that physical copies don&#8217;t have more value &#8211; they just don&#8217;t have\u00a0convenience.<\/p>\n<p>That all being said this is also a niche market. Amazon isn&#8217;t going to put collector and antique stores out of business. These are things that you normally can&#8217;t get in bulk or are extremely jacked up on Amazon. Even Ebay at is height couldn&#8217;t put these stores out of business. So there is a market and a business model for them. The instant gratification of needing it now will eventually slip away. If I had wanted the movie today it would have cost me only $6.00 more than I paid for the previous season. Insane. That however is the world now.<\/p>\n<p>As a side rant, why can&#8217;t I go to the flea market and get &#8220;cheap&#8221; comics anymore? When I was young I used to be able to get 10 for a dollar. Even with inflation accounted for .50 apiece would be expensive, but still cheaper than what they are offering. Everything now is 2.00 to cover price. All I want to do is give my son some comics, but it&#8217;s a pricey investment these days for something he will tear (we&#8217;ll work on that as he gets older).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; This last weekend I went to a local used music\/movie\/video game store just to browse.
