I remember people buying &#8220;classified&#8221; ads on it.\u00a0\u00a0 Obituaries were missing from that system.\u00a0\u00a0 So what have we left, stock quotes and obituaries?\u00a0 This transition could have been done literally decades ago.\u00a0\u00a0 How about an all-stock quote radio station?<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at some other aspects of this picture &#8211; in theory, most of us are evil human beings since we don&#8217;t utilize public transportation and drive our oil-guzzling vehicles around the country daily.\u00a0\u00a0 What about all the trees and wilderness decimated by using the wood pulp to supply the newspapers (millions a day) for the little bit of news that we couldn&#8217;t get somewhere else?\u00a0 This was rampant going well into the age of recycling, if it wasn&#8217;t for the ubiquity of the Internet we would still be doing it today.\u00a0 What example does this set? \u00a0 We could have used hemp as paper since hemp is infinitely more renewable than wood pulp paper, but we didn&#8217;t.\u00a0\u00a0 Some people didn&#8217;t like that idea and wanted to increase their own wealth.\u00a0 This is also not to forget all the oil trucks used for transporting, the coal and oil used to power these places that printed them.<\/p>\n<p>The other thing I can see my child asking when he becomes aware is, doesn&#8217;t it give too much power to one entity?\u00a0 Some towns managed to have two newspapers that provided coverage for their area, but what we are stuck with is just two viewpoints.\u00a0\u00a0 What if there was a story that neither wanted to print, in that era, it may well never have happened if it didn&#8217;t make TV, radio, or newsprint.\u00a0\u00a0 History and stories have been lost for decades since the story wouldn&#8217;t get more readers, so these companies could not sell more advertising.\u00a0 Then I would also have to explain the theory of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yellow_journalism\">Yellow Journalism<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m sure in the age of digital living that these children and grandchildren will understand advertising sponsorship to the news.\u00a0 What they will have a harder time with is news that was set typographically so that it couldn&#8217;t be manipulated.\u00a0 A system where you had to buy the paper just to know the news (a news tax as such). \u00a0 A system where if you wanted to sell something you were lucky if you had an audience within a fifty-mile radius.\u00a0 That we gave control of so much to so few and enjoyed it&#8230;.\u00a0 That we were so wasteful in our resources, when looking back it was just pure gluttony. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not sure how they will ever understand.<\/p>\n<p>I can say I used to wrestle the comics from my grandfather as he read the paper so I could enjoy them, and that is a fond family memory.\u00a0 I can&#8217;t say looking back that even I understood their purpose.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This story is coming from someone who was a newspaper boy, yet has never had a newspaper subscription in his life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here We hear time and time again about all the newspapers and magazines going out of business.\u00a0\u00a0 How much longer will they survive in the same sense that we have seen during our &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":102930,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3814"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3814"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3814\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/102930"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3814"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3814"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3814"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
