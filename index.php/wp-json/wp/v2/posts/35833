the joy of iTunes.\u00a0\u00a0 When it is tuned and working well, everything is a blessing.\u00a0\u00a0 When it is not working well &#8211; you can definitely want to slit your wrists with broken glass that has been fermented in a one-week-old diaper, but I&#8217;m not bitter.\u00a0\u00a0 Moving into the Apple ecosystem has had its challenges, and I have overcome most of them (until I got the Apple TV).\u00a0 In our household, we have 2 old hard drive-based iPods, 3 iPhones, and one Apple TV.\u00a0 Until Apple TV came along I used iTunes for music, podcasts, and syncing my iDevices.\u00a0 For the defenders out there, this worked well &#8211; no real issues.\u00a0\u00a0 Then the Apple TV came along and changed everything.\u00a0 We wanted to play video from the hard drive on the Apple TV &#8211; so I convert it all to MP4 and then import it into iTunes.\u00a0\u00a0 This is where I started to notice issues.<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0 Why can&#8217;t you specify the media you are importing?\u00a0\u00a0 If I am importing two seasons of a TV show, why does it automatically place video files under movies?\u00a0\u00a0 Why can&#8217;t I specify that I&#8217;m importing TV shows instead of making this a two-step edit process?<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 Automatic name detection and metadata updates on video files.\u00a0\u00a0 This is a huge pain in the butt to update all the album art on these files.\u00a0 I would understand videos that iTunes knows nothing about &#8211; but I have videos that are also available in the iTunes store.\u00a0 Those files should be able to update their album art the same way audio files do.\u00a0\u00a0 At this point, I would be happy if Apple did at least one.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 No differentiation between e-books and audiobooks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ever since they released iBooks this has been a huge pain.\u00a0\u00a0 Watching from a cover art perspective you can&#8217;t tell the difference between the two types.\u00a0\u00a0 These are two completely different types of media that are consumed in two completely different ways.\u00a0 If iTunes can give iTunes U its only little subsection why can&#8217;t these two media types?<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0 Music Videos have the same problem as books.\u00a0\u00a0 They are filed under &#8220;Music&#8221;.\u00a0\u00a0 These are video files and are consumed visually.\u00a0 They should also have their own subsection.\u00a0 They are not only filed under music, when you import them &#8211; they show up under movies and you have to change the type.\u00a0\u00a0 Please see number 1 again.<\/p>\n<p>You can see my problems are in the amount of time it takes to edit metadata and keep the library groomed.\u00a0\u00a0 My music files are meticulous.\u00a0\u00a0 This year for my music files (if I ever finish the video files) I plan on getting the bpm field filled in on all my music.\u00a0\u00a0 All my tracks have artist\/track information.\u00a0 All my albums have cover art.\u00a0\u00a0 Pristine and clean so I wouldn&#8217;t have to do it again.<\/p>\n<p>Why can&#8217;t videos and books have it as easy?\u00a0 If video wasn&#8217;t such a big push with the Apple TV I might understand this more.<\/p>\n<p>I talked about writing this post months ago and just now got around to it.\u00a0 Give me some time and I&#8217;ll come up with more.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ahhhhh &#8211;
