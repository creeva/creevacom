You can look over there to see the name of the prime suspect.<\/p>\n<p>I read about this teacher and the connection a few years ago when it was in a local paper. \u00a0I read it, I absorbed it, and I moved on. \u00a0 I had nothing to add to it. \u00a0 While I remember this teacher, I remember him as a substitute. \u00a0 I remember his name and his face tied together, I don&#8217;t remember much else. \u00a0 I can&#8217;t tell you if he was a good guy. \u00a0 I can&#8217;t tell you if I think he did it. \u00a0 From personal experiences, it was someone I meant who is just a face in the crowd. \u00a0 Yet, what an irony that I crossed paths even innocently with him.<\/p>\n<p>The Amy Mihaljevic case was the story of the boogey man to parents across Northern Ohio. \u00a0 A girl was abducted in the middle and just up and disappeared for months. \u00a0 Four months after her disappearance her body was found in a field halfway between my hometown and the where I currently reside. \u00a0 I&#8217;ve driven within at least a mile of Amy&#8217;s discovery site at least a thousand times. \u00a0 I have never stopped to see it, and likely never will purposely seek it out.<\/p>\n<p>My mother was scared for my sisters growing up at this time. \u00a0 My one sister was two and the other was a newborn. \u00a0For years it scared my mother to let the girls play in the front yard of our fairly solid middle class neighborhood. \u00a0 I would always have to keep an eye on them, which I&#8217;m sure you can imagine is every teenagers dream. \u00a0Yet, my parents moved to Vermilion from Elyria so their children could go to a better school system. \u00a0 They wanted a safer environment from where we were living. \u00a0So we moved to a small lakeside community.<\/p>\n<p>Sometime during my school years I had the teacher who allegedly was the one responsible for the fear that struck this part of the state. \u00a0 I use the word allegedly very strongly. \u00a0 Most of the accusations come from the writer that has written the book on the case. \u00a0 He complains that his theories fall on deaf ears with the Bay Village Police Department and the FBI. \u00a0 He seems to have solved it in his mind and he is smarter than everyone else involved.<\/p>\n<p>The writer has become judge, jury, and he seems so determine &#8211; even executioner if the teacher is found guilty. \u00a0 I read through most of his blog, he uses conjecture and allegations just as much as fact. \u00a0 The police don&#8217;t trust the sketch of the suspect since it was done the day by two 10 year old children. \u00a0 Yet, he uses the sketch as absolute proof. \u00a0 While he does write a convincing yarn there are holes in the theory. \u00a0 The largest one was offered up by a redditor. \u00a0 Since this teacher taught in Amherst, and the abduction happened about 20 minutes after school\u00a0in Bay Village &#8211; it makes an unlikely timeline.<\/p>\n<p>The teacher from the stories was admittedly strange. \u00a0 He did give up his teaching license instead of getting fingerprinted &#8211; but then again the writer points out there was allegations of impropriety of the teacher. \u00a0These allegations started an investigation by the school. \u00a0 Depending of what happened, he may have been asked to leave. \u00a0 Yet, he wasn&#8217;t convicted of a crime. \u00a0 If you start looking at the conjectures that are made you will see more questions.<\/p>\n<p>There are rumors that the writer treats as fact. \u00a0 I can say that there was many rumors of the &#8220;less than acceptable&#8221; nature by many teachers in schools. \u00a0 From drug use, to sitting girls in the front and looking up their skirts, to full affairs between teachers and students. \u00a0 Anyone with a brain knows that these rumors happen in about every school. \u00a0That you need to separate he said\/she said with something more. \u00a0Especially coming from Vermilion where rumors run wild.<\/p>\n<p>The largest evidence is the theory that the teacher met Amy and other girls who received phone calls from a local nature center. \u00a0 This is a theory that only the author takes seriously. \u00a0 The Police and the FBI haven&#8217;t publicly added any weight to these claims. \u00a0 Then again the authorities had a press conference twenty-seven years later to ask the public to identify a curtain. \u00a0 If this piece was so crucial, it should have been released at least twenty-six years ago. \u00a0 I was hoping the press conference today would announce a suspect to this cold case. \u00a0 Maybe the curtain will add to a new lead &#8211; or it might be the end of this case.<\/p>\n<p>No matter who the guilty party is, we have to make sure we don&#8217;t go on a witch hunt. \u00a0We can&#8217;t throw names around for years and smear them across the internet without proof. \u00a0 I just suggest you go and read for yourself. \u00a0 Don&#8217;t read a single article this writer has put out there, read the breadth. \u00a0 He is convinced many people are the likely killer &#8211; the teacher though is still at the top of his list. \u00a0 Don&#8217;t get manipulated into hate and fear just because someone said so. \u00a0 The police questioned the teacher years ago &#8211; and nothing came further of it.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe some day we will get answers &#8211; but all we have today is rumor and speculation&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not the actual teacher Since you have read the headline I will say that the investigation is still ongoing. \u00a0 That I have no idea if the teacher is question is guilty or not. \u00a0 &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95140,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95139"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95139"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95139\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95140"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95139"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95139"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95139"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
