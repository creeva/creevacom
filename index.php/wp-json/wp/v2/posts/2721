The poster (I&#8217;m looking at you Tevy) thought I was using Twitter to crosspost to everything. Here was my reply:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Tevy&#8217;s my setup is kind of unique but I&#8217;ll give you the run down.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I post to my blog at localhost\/wordpress &#8211; when I make a post my blog crossposts to myspace, vox, livejournal, dandelife, blogger, msn spaces, xanga, and multiply.<\/p>\n<p>My website also has an outbound feed &#8211; this is filtered to certain topics and posts notifications to twitter, tumblr, jaiku, facebook, and suprglu.<\/p>\n<p>At then end of the day all the web services that I use (flickr, allconsuming, 43things, 43 places, cocomment, digg, del.icio.us, google reader shared items, youtube favorites, youtube uploads, picasa, photobucket, stumbleupon, newsvine, pownce, and any other blogs I use) are each wrapped up with whatever I&#8217;ve done on any of those respectice services through out the day and done as a single post (per service) on my blog.<\/p>\n<p>Of course once a post is made on my blog it gets cross posted to myspace etc, with the exception of twitter (since I use it for notifications AND personal use) nothing really hits my blog twice since I&#8217;ve been very careful of any redundant data processing.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll just say I love wordpress plugins<\/p>\n<p>A few article I&#8217;ve written on this:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/01\/11\/life-caching-is-better-then-life-streams\/<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/01\/23\/brand-management-branding-yourself\/<\/p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m sure what I&#8217;ve written above is missing some services and such but that&#8217;s about 90% of what is going on. <\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Now I know that this leads to a lot of updates on myspace, but I&#8217;m sure this seems unnatural to some since most of the people I know post next to nothing. 99% of the updates I see are XXXX&#8217;s updated profile information. I look at the profile and it looks the same to me. Very few people actually constantly upload pictures (I&#8217;m looking at an automated way to do this from my Flickr account) or write blog posts. So sometimes I need to go to other services to find the people like me that update their profile information and create content.<\/p>\n<p>I truly want to read content from people I know, look at their pictures, or watch their videos it&#8217;s just that there seems to be so little, while I, of course, go through my cross-posting glut. My friends don&#8217;t like switching services and that&#8217;s fine, I&#8217;ll just bring all my glut of information and data to them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was accused the other day of spamming Myspace with all of my updates, though it was indirectly on a friend&#8217;s blog via the comment section of a post he did on Twitter.
