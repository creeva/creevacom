She also informed me that her and my grandfather were going to Michigan this weekend to go my grandfather&#8217;s 60th high school reunion. She commented that it seemed like along time ago. At first it did. It seem like this far off memory. Graduating in 1948 must have been like it was an eon ago, somethign I can&#8217;t fathom or get in touch with. She also told me that my uncle was coming in a few weeks to go to his 30th high school re-union.<\/p>\n<p>After thinking about it for a bit, 60 years though didn&#8217;t seem that long. From a purely cosmic level it&#8217;s an instant. A brief nanosecond in the scal of the universe. However I normally deal in more relative time. While we were talking I realized that next year will be my 15th high school reuinion. I&#8217;m already a quarter of the way there. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about that, but I do realize that the 60th reunion doesn&#8217;t seem as far away as it does on the surface.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here I talked to my grandmother today trying to get her to give my some photographs to scan in, she agreed.
