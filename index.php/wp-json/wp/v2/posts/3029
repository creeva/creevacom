She also informed me that she and my grandfather were going to Michigan this weekend to go to my grandfather&#8217;s 60th high school reunion. She commented that it seemed like a long time ago. At first, it did. It seems like this far-off memory. Graduating in 1948 must have been like it was an eon ago, something I can&#8217;t fathom or get in touch with. She also told me that my uncle was coming in a few weeks to go to his 30th high school reunion.<\/p>\n<p>After thinking about it for a bit, 60 years though didn&#8217;t seem that long. From a purely cosmic level, it&#8217;s instant. A brief nanosecond in the scale of the universe. However, I normally deal in more relative time. While we were talking I realized that next year will be my 15th high school reunion. I&#8217;m already a quarter of the way there. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about that, but I do realize that the 60th reunion doesn&#8217;t seem as far away as it does on the surface.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here I talked to my grandmother today trying to get her to give me some photographs to scan in, and she agreed.
