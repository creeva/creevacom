I&#8217;ve really fought with this problem literally for over a decade now (yes in 1995 I had a computer hooked up to a stereo and a TV).<\/p>\n<p>The last incarnation I was using was a first-generation <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mac_mini\">Mac Mini<\/a>. The problem was that the streaming wasn&#8217;t fast enough for the Mac Mini (ironically every other computer in the house streamed just fine). So I would have to copy video files over to the computer manually to get completely stutter-free playback. I dealt though until just a couple of months ago.<\/p>\n<p>In November I purchased my first original <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xbox\">X-Box<\/a> (yes I&#8217;m behind the times). I had always wanted to run <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xbmc\">XBOX Media Center<\/a> on it, but didn&#8217;t want to go through the soldering effort to put a mod chip in, or track down esoteric software with the action replay kit to soft-mod it. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boards.ie\/vbulletin\/showthread.php?s=c044cdf4cdab2a3aa85bccdd99f500e7&amp;t=2055256404\">I did manage to find instructions on how to mod the Xbox and install XBMC<\/a> with things I already had, such as a computer and screwdrivers. The most frightening thing about it was hot-swapping a live IDE hard drive. Years of tech work have told me this is a no-no, but I did it anyway and it worked.<\/p>\n<p>I even went out and purchased a remote control for the X-Box and can now browse from the couch. I went back and forth on whether to get a wireless controller or the remote, I settled on the remote because it was cheaper and more intuitive for anyone other than myself.<\/p>\n<p>For MP3 playback we sometimes use the X-Box installation, but more than likely we are either using iPods, our N810s, or the whole main floor audio we have going. In the basement, we have a computer working as an MP3 jukebox. Off of this machine, there are 3 different sets of speakers (one is the main stereo system) &#8211; that can cover the whole first floor of the house in zoned audio. Each room has its own volume control and it works fairly well. In the next year, I will more than likely start running the cables upstairs to work on whole-house audio.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The biggest problem of course with moving to digital is how are you going to get the videos or music to where you want them to be.
