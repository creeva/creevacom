I&#8217;ve really fought with this problem literally for over a decade now (yes in 1995 I had a computer hooked up to a stereo and a TV).<\/p>\n<p>The last incarnation I was using was a first generation <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mac_mini\">Mac Mini<\/a>. The problem was that the streaming wasn&#8217;t fast enough for the Mac Mini (ironically every other computer in the house streamed just fine). So I would have to copy video files over to the computer manually to get completely stutter free playback. I dealt though until just a couple months ago.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/06\/25241898_aa45084bd8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"407\" height=\"271\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/miskan\/25241898\/\">Image from here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In November I purchased my first original <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xbox\">X-Box<\/a> (yes I&#8217;m behind the times). I had always wanted to run <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xbmc\">XBOX Media Center<\/a> on it, but didn&#8217;t want to go through the soldering effort to put a mod chip in, or track down esoteric software with the action replay kit to soft mod it. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boards.ie\/vbulletin\/showthread.php?s=c044cdf4cdab2a3aa85bccdd99f500e7&amp;t=2055256404\">I did manage to find instructions on how to mod the x-box and install XBMC<\/a> with things I already had, such as a computer and screw drivers. The most frightening thing about it was hot swapping a live IDE hard drive. Years of tech work has told me this is a no-no, but I did it anyway and it worked.<\/p>\n<p>I even went out and purchased a remote control for the X-Box and can now browse from the couch. I went back and forth on whether to get a wireless controller or the remote, I settled on the remote because it was cheaper and more intuitive for anyone other then myself.<\/p>\n<p>For MP3 playback we sometimes use the X-Box installation, but more then likely we are either using ipods, our N810&#8217;s, or the whole main floor audio we have going. In the basement we have a computer working as an MP3 jukebox. Off of this machine there is 3 different sets of speakers (one is the main stereo system) &#8211; that can cover the whole first floor of the house in zoned audio. Each room has it&#8217;s own volume control and it works fairly well. In the next year I will more then likely start running the cables upstairs to work on whole house audio.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from here The biggest problem of course with moving to digital is how are you going to get the videos or music to where you want them to be.
