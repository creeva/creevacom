The sign was one of those, change it weekly, amaze your worshippers, and make drivers think type of signs. This week it only said &#8220;Remember, Thou Shalt Not Covet&#8221;. Now to preface this I consider myself a liberal christian who doesn&#8217;t believe in organized religion. I&#8217;d go more into that, but that&#8217;s a discussion for another day. You may consider me a heathen, but I don&#8217;t consider myself one.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Thinking about the sign though just shows my how hipocritical we are when it comes to religion. We consider ourselves a christian nation but don&#8217;t follow it. I think the religion needs to be seperated from the government down to removing in god we trust from the money. More fitting for the American economy is &#8220;In Money We Trust&#8221;. If we didn&#8217;t covet things we wouldn&#8217;t be in the housing crisis we are now. Gas prices would not be rising. You wouldn&#8217;t worry about sending your kid to a better private school then your neighbors do. <\/p>\n<p>Coveting advances civilization.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I said it. Coveting does advance civilization. If we didn&#8217;t see things and want something better we would still be living in caves and eating random plants that hopefully grew outside. We wouldn&#8217;t see an animal and try to kill it. We wouldn&#8217;t build a house. We wouldn&#8217;t drive cars. We want these things, we covet them. You can deny you covet things all you want, but with very small percentage of people you covet something. I do.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Which brings out the fact of a church having this on the sign. A church really really wishes to grow (part of the reason I think religion is personal and shoudn&#8217;t be a group effort). They want to grow so much they now advertise for members. If this isn&#8217;t coveting I don&#8217;t know what is. Because of this a church having a sign that as advertisement designed to entice people into the church stating &#8211; though shalt not covet &#8211; it&#8217;s in the extreme of hypocriticalness. Maybe churches aren&#8217;t the sin free places some people think they are.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here Today while I was driving home for work and I noticed a new church sign put up on the road side in front of a country church.
