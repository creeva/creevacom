The comment was written on the <a href=\"http:\/\/entertainment.slashdot.org\/entertainment\/08\/05\/21\/2250231.shtml\">Secret History of Star Wars article<\/a> and was given by <a href=\"http:\/\/slashdot.org\/~Omestes\">Omestes<\/a> and was as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Oh god, the Nerd\/Dork\/Geek argument. We always went with nerds being unwashed, antisocial geniuses who small vaguely like cheese, and somehow manage to reference Yoda, and differential equations in every utterance. Dorks are just like nerds, but dumber. And geeks are the swashbuckling generalists who get all the chicks (er&#8230;) because they have some modicum of social skills, while still knowing their swallows apart.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>By your jargon though, there still is a deep relation between nerds and dorks, since both of them are &#8220;systems&#8221; people. D&amp;D is just another complex system to play with, just like math, code, and circuits. As is, oddly, the various nerd friendly mythologies. Both groups, by your classification, are equally likely to get the chicks&#8230; Not very. Neither math nor D&amp;D impress many of the chicks I know.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>So where does arguing over the semantics of nerdery put one?<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now, this has been written about hundreds of times (if you don&#8217;t believe check google), but wanted to stick my two cents into this discussion. Let&#8217;s go over my own definitions:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/farm3.static.flickr.com\/2042\/2496970172_1c8d57b38f_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Picture from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/cafrine\/2496970172\/\">here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Dork:<\/strong> <em>A dork is an individual that has an interest in something so far that they are singled out and people believe because of some title given to them they are thought to be an expert. In all actuality, they are no better than a lay person and have the largest social anxieties and problems dealing with others. They normally think they are smarter than they are, but yet normally lack in-depth knowledge to move them up the dork\/nerd\/geek ladder.<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>However, there is a missing factor to this definition, which is the fact that a dork is more likely to be the one that non-dorks\/nerds\/geeks are most comfortable around. They are the ones that come off as lovable &#8211; like when your friends or significant other says &#8220;You big dork&#8221;. While in some terms dork is an insult, when you properly it is definitely the least offensive to the general population at large. <\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/farm1.static.flickr.com\/157\/432403537_cb90b1b01e_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"168\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Picture from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/87039192@N00\/432403537\/\">here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Nerd:<\/strong> <em>Nerds are individuals that have an interest in things that go so far that not only do they have to prove they are better than everyone on the subject of interest, but they also are so intensely interested in their area of focus that social situations really don&#8217;t bother them. It&#8217;s a waste of time for them. They don&#8217;t know why you don&#8217;t want to dig into replicating a hologram in your microwave with tin foil and baking soda, which they do daily for amusement. <\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/farm1.static.flickr.com\/47\/117475912_3fd9d3884d_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Picture from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sachaqs\/117475912\/\">here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Geek:<\/strong> <em>Geeks usually can deal with society the best, but completely zone out similar to nerds to nerds, but are normally capable of human relationships, though they took the hologram in the microwave and made a short film out of it to upload to youtube.

Normally geeks wear the term geek on themselves with a badge of honor. <\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I can say in certain areas I&#8217;m all three, but I&#8217;m mostly a geek. I&#8217;m normally quite knowledgeable in the things I have an extreme interest in, and I&#8217;m capable of zoning out. Most of my family considers me a nerd when it comes to social networks (and I really am when it comes to cross-posting). When it comes to certain items and gadgets I&#8217;m definitely a dork trying to be a geek.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m sticking myself into any of these groups.
