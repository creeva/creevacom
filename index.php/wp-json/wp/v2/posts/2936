they believe that sunshine and dirt make strong boys.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m more of the give me a book and a bed to lay on, or a laptop and a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nintendo.com\">Gameboy<\/a> with a bed to lay on type of guy.<\/p>\n<p>They don&#8217;t, however, use web-based e-mail &#8211; I haven&#8217;t used a strictly POP3 mail solution since <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ashland.edu\">college<\/a> &#8211; so 14 years of using web-based e-mail.\u00a0 With the exception of corporate mail, I can&#8217;t understand using it any other way.\u00a0\u00a0 Spam control is easier, you can access your e-mail from anywhere, and you can archive your mail online without ever losing anything.\u00a0 I started a series about computing in the clouds and even did one subject on web based e-mail.\u00a0 The generation that comes after us (and the age difference is pretty much a generation) should have a more refined method of handling data.\u00a0\u00a0 It seems they choose to hamstring themselves than to learn and be more interactive.\u00a0\u00a0 That is not the case.<\/p>\n<p>I have a sister that is pretty much from the mindset of using the computer as a utility or appliance.\u00a0\u00a0 It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s only slightly more interactive than a game system or television set.\u00a0\u00a0 I understand that mentality.\u00a0\u00a0 I figured however it was something that would end with my generation.\u00a0 It seems not, the next generation at least in my family is not grasping and making tech work for them they are working for their technology.\u00a0 What I mean by that is they put more effort into the computer than they need to, the computer should be a tool to make things faster and easier.\u00a0\u00a0 Not using it to the fullest extent you can and streamlining what you do is almost a shame.<\/p>\n<p>My 26-year-old brother and I when we had our own computers kept pushing the line and seeing what we can do next.\u00a0 He was twelve\/thirteen when I went to college and he was running his own <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bulletin_board_system\">BBS<\/a>.\u00a0\u00a0 He went the design and programming route.\u00a0 I went the security and architecture route.\u00a0\u00a0 Both of us are very good at what we do in our own fields &#8211; at least we think so.\u00a0 Though we have a very little overlap since both of us view the other person as focusing on the wrong things.\u00a0 The thirteen-year-olds don&#8217;t have the same in-depth interaction with their computers.\u00a0\u00a0 Maybe this is a problem with growing up with computers their whole lives.\u00a0\u00a0 It&#8217;s not viewed with the same regard as it was for me and my next youngest brother.<\/p>\n<p>It does give me some slight hope that the current twenty-something and young thirty-somethings are the height of the internet users while the rest of them stagnate and fully pushed the line.\u00a0\u00a0 But the youngest brothers have a few years to catch up and may do something with it yet, so I can&#8217;t fully discount them until the future arrives.<\/p>\n<p>Now if they are reading this &#8211; go get a <a href=\"http:\/\/mail.google.com\">Gmail<\/a> address and learn how to use it.\u00a0\u00a0 My father-in-law and mother-in-law have even moved to Gmail and it only took them a few minutes to learn it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here I thought the teens and pre-teens were the sounding board for tomorrow&#8217;s technology.\u00a0\u00a0 Well, this isn&#8217;t always the case.\u00a0\u00a0 I previously mentioned talking with my brother over the weekend.\u00a0\u00a0 Well, there is &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":99472,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2936"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2936"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2936\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/99472"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2936"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2936"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2936"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
