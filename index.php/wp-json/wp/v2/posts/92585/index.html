In 1965 when they purchased The Pirate Ride from <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Freedomland_U.S.A.\">Freedomland<\/a> they also purchased another dark ride, Earthquake. Looking at dates of operation Earthquake was open a full year at Cedar Point before The Pirate Ride opened.<\/p>\n<p>While the theme of the ride is clear from its name it does get a little more specific. It was based on the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1906_earthquake\">1906 San Francisco earthquake<\/a>. So if I remember correctly there were\u00a0a few San Francisco landmarks in the ride. For this ride to be at Cedar Point was strange. The ride, in a way, was a celebration of of one of the greatest disasters in the United States. Thinking about it, this makes this ride more morbid than the hangings in The Pirate Ride.<\/p>\n<p>The ride&#8217;s last season was 1984. It was replaced with Berenstain Bears land. It was located at the current location of the Snoopy Boutique on the main midway. I&#8217;m sure that they will say they removed the ride due to poor ridership. I prefer to think that they came to their senses. Cute bears giving manner lessons are more profitable than celebrating tragedy.<\/p>\n<p>I wish I could go in-depth with this ride. I was seven or eight the last time I rode it. My memories back to this age are not as sharp as when I started to enter my teenage years. I can tell you that I remember the buildings\u00a0collapsing on the cars. The effect was that the buildings would tilt over the ride car and almost hit you. It was a mad dash to get through before the world fell apart around you.<\/p>\n<p>Supposedly this is a recording of the fortune-teller from the ride. To be honest I don&#8217;t remember the ride well enough to verify if this is correct. I&#8217;ll let those that remember the ride better than I do judge it.<\/p>\n<p><center><iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/B6mEni2Jsmk\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"><\/iframe><\/center><center><\/center><center><\/center><br \/>\nIf you remember any else about this ride, feel free to leave a comment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scanned postcard found on Flickr Yesterday I talked about The Pirate Ride which was a dark ride that Cedar Point.
