It was actually my father above that took my son to a Halloween gathering when he was one year old. Looking at this picture, my father (and not myself) might be to blame for Lex&#8217;s Star Wars obsession. I obviously did my part to nurture that.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I went over my past Halloween costumes, I thought sharing Lex&#8217;s would be the proper next post.<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center>Shortly before his second birthday, the above kid Darth Vader commercial came up. I remember the first time he saw it, it was enamored. We had to play it over and over for him that day while he sat in his high chair. This led to the Halloween costume that year.<\/p>\n<p>This is the first year he went as Darth Vader. While we went to Boo at the Zoo, I had my iPhone blaring the Imperial March. Lex marched like he was in power and control.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94626\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/lexandxie2011-1-270x300.jpg\" alt=\"lexandxie2011\" width=\"270\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/lexandxie2011-1-270x300.jpg 270w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/lexandxie2011-1.jpg 453w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here is another shot from that year.

While we were trick or treating some kid started arguing with him that Kylo was to blame for Vader&#8217;s death. I&#8217;m assuming the kid is working from some of the conspiracy theories online. Lex attempted to argue with him and set him straight. I managed to pull him away to continue to get candy. It was interesting watching the geek arguments start so young. Later on we discussed theories where the kid could be correct. The only one that Lex would accept is if Kylo Ren was Emperor Palpatine. A clone of Emperor Palpatine also would not count (according to him) since that would still be a different person.<\/p>\n<p>For school today (sorry no picture), he had to go as something without a mask and non-violent. Lex pulled out an old Superman costume and went to school wearing that. When he got home it had specs of frosting all over it. I guess Superman has at least one more weakness other than Kryptonite and magic&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Being the child of two haunted house workers, you would think we would be all about getting him to do the Halloween thing early on.
