It&#8217;s right up there with the number 42. Of course, it has a closer association with 1.21. Unless you have lived under a rock, or were born after 1990, you will always associate this with the movie Back To The Future.<\/p>\n<p>I saw Back to the Future in the theater two or three times. Which was fantastic since I was only nine years old when it came out. The movie fascinated me. I think one of the viewings was at the Drive-In theater in Lorain. This meant I saw it larger than life since big stadium seating theaters didn&#8217;t exist at the time. Back to the Future was also the videotape I owned. A movie that was all my own that I got for Christmas. I became a child obsessed with reaching eighty-eight miles per hour.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the point isn&#8217;t to just go eighty-eight miles per hour, the point is to do it in the correct car. It has to be done in a DeLorean. You can also bet the farm that if I ever get a chance to drive a DeLorean I will attempt to get to that speed. I&#8217;m obviously not alone in this idea.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.com\/underwire\/2012\/06\/ernie-cline-delorean\/\">In an article written by Wired<\/a>, the author of Ready, Player One and Fanboys, Ernie Cline has a DeLorean. He actually has two of them. One is for a contest for the paperback release of his book. The article described how his souped-up car just by coolness alone has gotten him out of a couple of speeding tickets.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that he wants a speeding ticket. He doesn&#8217;t want just any speeding ticket he is looking for a particular one:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>As much of a completist as any nerd, Cline wants to get written up for driving\u00a088 mph. He came close once, in Michigan, when he got pulled over doing 76 in a 65 mph zone. But the officer wouldn\u2019t boost the speed on his citation (which had to be one of the geekier requests in the history of law enforcement).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI begged [the officer],\u201d Cline recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Could you please raise the speed up to 88?\u2019 I said, \u2018I will pay the additional fine just so I can have this ticket and frame it for all time.\u2019\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Thinking about that though, wouldn&#8217;t you want a ticket for eighty-seven miles an hour? You could tell your friends that you almost disappeared into the time stream but you just couldn&#8217;t get away. That would be the excuse I would use. I guess you could always use the old flux capacitor didn&#8217;t kick in excuse. You could try is that your Mister Fusion was out of fuel. Finally, maybe you forgot to run to the local corner store to pick up plutonium.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the excuse, I would be impressed if someone had a picture of themselves in a DeLorean with an eighty-eight-mile-per-hour speeding ticket attached to it. It doesn&#8217;t get much geekier than that.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>88 miles per hour is one of those magical spots. It&#8217;s right up there with the number 42.
