Lewis. \u00a0 Of course there were alternative media we could turn to, but as children we were spoon fed pop culture. \u00a0 I ate it up (obviously). \u00a0 To be fair though so did most people I know.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure I was excited at the prospect of Flinstone Vitamins. Around age four I started taking them on a daily basis. \u00a0I remember liking the Dino pills the best. \u00a0 Thanks to the rerun culture of the UHF stations, I was very familiar with the Flintstones. \u00a0 My favorite part of the credits was where Dino was thrown outside. \u00a0 My second favorite was the rack of dinosaur ribs knocking over the car. \u00a0 I&#8217;m sure I begged to start taking these vitamins, and take them I did.<\/p>\n<p>I loved them and took a single pill every single day. \u00a0 Until the bright idea dawned upon me that if one pill is good for you, more pills must be better. \u00a0 Granted as an adult we all have that friend. \u00a0The one who says well if one glass of red wine is healthy for the heart &#8211; I&#8217;m a champ because I downed the whole bottle. \u00a0 While our livers can recover from drinking too much wine on occasion, vitamins can be a bit trickier of a thing. \u00a0I ended up testing this theory.<\/p>\n<p>I was around five years old when I put my many vitamins plan into action. \u00a0 My parents were headed out for something. \u00a0I remember it being a school play, but I think I&#8217;m wrong with that. \u00a0After dinner I had my normal vitamin. \u00a0 Now this was the earliest of the eighties so things like childproof bottles didn&#8217;t exist yet. \u00a0 \u00a0While my parents were getting ready I went into the kitchen and climbed up on the counter. \u00a0 I then opened the cupboard and opened the bottle. \u00a0 Then I took it upon myself to eat most if not all of a complete bottle of Flinstone Vitamins.<\/p>\n<p>A few minutes later my parents came down and I showed them that I ate all of my vitamins. \u00a0 They of course did what any reasonable parent would do &#8211; they flipped out. \u00a0 They got on the phone and called poison control. \u00a0 Poison control did not have a good answer, but there was some concern about the amount of iron I had taken. \u00a0 The concern was so great that they rushed me to the Amherst hospital to get my stomach pumped.<\/p>\n<p>Being five years old I assumed they were either going to cut a hole in my side and pump out the stuff directly. \u00a0 Then the second thought was that they would stick a tube down my throat and suck it all out. \u00a0 Neither scenario seemed appealing to me at all. \u00a0 So I did what every five year old does and through a fit and fought everything the whole way. \u00a0 I remember being in the ER and the stomach pumping ended up being nothing mechanical at all. \u00a0They started by handing me a metal bowl. \u00a0 Then they gave me a spoonful of liquid (syrup of ipecac). \u00a0Then for what seemed to be hours I was heaving it out of my system. \u00a0It was not a fun time.<\/p>\n<p>I can imagine what it would be if there was a kindergarten activity that night I missed. \u00a0 I would have been the first peer to those other kindergartners that ever went through an overdose. \u00a0 I would have been the hard edge kid from the wrong side of the tracks. \u00a0 All the girls would have loved me and the guys would want to be me. \u00a0 I would be the kid other parents would be wary of allowing their kids around. \u00a0Granted it was Flinstone Vitamins, but what other substance can you really joke about a child getting an overdose on? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Besides, for those that know me, I&#8217;m so not that kid. \u00a0 Heck, I think just by posting this article &#8211; anyone reading this article knows I was not that kid.<\/p>\n<p>That moment was a turning point for things. \u00a0 Around that time period I became a very picky eater. \u00a0 I still attribute that to the trauma of getting my stomach pumped. \u00a0As I aged I got better with things, but I seem to remember it being a night and day difference for tastes. \u00a0 The idea of hard chewable vitamins themselves churns my stomach. \u00a0 I haven&#8217;t had them since that day, but I can remember the flavor that enticed me to eat a whole bottle. \u00a0 That memory of flavor is enough to make me nauseous.<\/p>\n<p>I fought my wife for years on taking vitamins because of that incident. \u00a0Occasionally I will take gummi vitamins that don&#8217;t taste anything like the chewables. \u00a0 Still, it&#8217;s a battle because of that experience. \u00a0 The funniest thing though is that when I used to give blood, they would always comment about how high my iron level was. \u00a0 Granted, as an adult who understands metabolization and common sense, I know that their is no way the vitaman of overdose of youth changed my body to produce excess iron decades later. \u00a0You would need gamma rays or be a full blown mutant for that type of thing to occur. \u00a0 The best advice I can add having been traumatized by this myself &#8211; if you think you want to eat Flintstone Vitamins because they taste good &#8211; <em><strong>Yabba Dabba Don&#8217;t<\/strong><\/em>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I mentioned yesterday about my anger towards my first teddy bear. \u00a0 Today let&#8217;s talk about my first experience of being rushed to the hospital to get my stomach pumped. \u00a0 That&#8217;s a bit disingenuous, &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95097,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95091"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95091"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95091\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95097"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95091"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95091"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95091"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
