Albums with multiple CDs have now been consolidated under a single name instead of having album names ending in CD1 and CD2. It actually looks good.<\/p>\n<p>I do have to admit that some of the albums I had no idea what the true genre is though. \u00a0So these items got lumped together under Rock or Pop depending on how I felt at that moment. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t really use the genre tab too much, so it&#8217;s just a guideline anyways. \u00a0If anyone wants to spend hours sorting out proper genres they are more than welcome to.<\/p>\n<p>This cleanliness does come at a price. \u00a0 It took me about 6 hours going through and removing duplicate tracks, consolidating information, and downloading cover art and applying it. \u00a0 It is not a job for the weak of heart to power through. \u00a0 Watching Breaking Bad while I did this is probably the only reason I could maintain my sanity. \u00a0I still have to do with other digital media also. \u00a0 It makes everything prettier and easier to find. \u00a0I just wish that it didn&#8217;t take so long. \u00a0Even with automation tools it takes tons of time.<\/p>\n<p>After I got the metadata &#8220;masters&#8221; done on my desktop I deleted all the earlier non-perfectly cleaned tracks out of the file server. \u00a0 I set the server then to reimport all the tracks again. \u00a0I was going to bed when I was done anyways so it didn&#8217;t affect me at all.<\/p>\n<p>I thought briefly about re-importing them to the laptop. \u00a0 The problem with this is that it will screw up all of my playlists. \u00a0 I wish there was a good way to sync metadata updates between computers. \u00a0 I do know the &#8220;hacks&#8221; using a central repository, but that doesn&#8217;t fix the problem of keeping an archive at home and having one to take with you at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Now if I could only fit all the music into a single Google Music account. \u00a0 I&#8217;m going to start uploading tracks there soon. \u00a0The only reason I have not done that is the screwed up metadata. \u00a0 I guess I don&#8217;t have much of an excuse now.<\/p>\n<p>Onto to mixing the metadata on the DVD rips&#8230;&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A little over a year ago I was almost done with getting my mp3 metadata into shape. \u00a0I had a few stragglers but the majority was complete and I would get to it eventually. \u00a0 &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":78439,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/78426"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=78426"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/78426\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/78439"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=78426"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=78426"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=78426"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
