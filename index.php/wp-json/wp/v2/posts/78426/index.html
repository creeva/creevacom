I had a few stragglers but the majority was complete and I would get to it eventually. Over the last year my collection has grown a lot. That small part that was probably under 10% of the collection had ballooned to 25-30% with all the new items that I was too lazy to update. For those curious I have a ton of classical and video game music. The local library has also helped my collection grow.<\/p>\n<p>Last night I finally sat down and fixed them. I fixed them all. I have 100% metadata done in my Itunes library. All albums have an artist. All albums have cover art. Genres are consolidated down to about 15 different types. Each artist only has a single listing (I&#8217;ve fixed typos and spelling differences). Albums with multiple CDs have now been consolidated under a single name instead of having album names ending in CD1 and CD2. It actually looks good.<\/p>\n<p>I do have to admit that some of the albums I had no idea what the true genre is though. So these items got lumped together under Rock or Pop depending on how I felt at that moment. I don&#8217;t really use the genre tab too much, so it&#8217;s just a guideline anyways. If anyone wants to spend hours sorting out proper genres they are more than welcome to.<\/p>\n<p>This cleanliness does come at a price. It took me about 6 hours going through and removing duplicate tracks, consolidating information, and downloading cover art and applying it. It is not a job for the weak of heart to power through. Watching Breaking Bad while I did this is probably the only reason I could maintain my sanity. I still have to do with other digital media also. It makes everything prettier and easier to find. I just wish that it didn&#8217;t take so long. Even with automation tools it takes tons of time.<\/p>\n<p>After I got the metadata &#8220;masters&#8221; done on my desktop I deleted all the earlier non-perfectly cleaned tracks out of the file server. I set the server then to reimport all the tracks again. I was going to bed when I was done anyways so it didn&#8217;t affect me at all.<\/p>\n<p>I thought briefly about re-importing them to the laptop. The problem with this is that it will screw up all of my playlists. I wish there was a good way to sync metadata updates between computers. I do know the &#8220;hacks&#8221; using a central repository, but that doesn&#8217;t fix the problem of keeping an archive at home and having one to take with you at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Now if I could only fit all the music into a single Google Music account. I&#8217;m going to start uploading tracks there soon. The only reason I have not done that is the screwed up metadata. I guess I don&#8217;t have much of an excuse now.<\/p>\n<p>Onto to mixing the metadata on the DVD rips&#8230;&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A little over a year ago I was almost done with getting my mp3 metadata into shape.
