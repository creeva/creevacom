I woke up and I was holding my phone and it hadn&#8217;t self locked yet. \u00a0 I actually read a few more pages and then went to sleep properly.<\/p>\n<p>In the last few months I have read more than I have in the last 3 -4 years combined. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not up to my reading prime days, but it&#8217;s pretty much in full force. \u00a0 Before I would read if I took a bath or just had a few minutes to kill. \u00a0 It would take me weeks to finish any books, if I finished them at all.<\/p>\n<p>Since December I&#8217;m on my third Oz book with Lex. \u00a0Most nights we do a chapter a night to calm him down. \u00a0He lies and listens. \u00a0 Some days he is more interested than others. \u00a0 We&#8217;ve done this he a little over a year old. \u00a0 Currently we are on the sixteenth book in the series,\u00a0 <em>Kabumpo in Oz<\/em>. \u00a0I wonder how far we will get before I either have to start over as he can pay more attention now or when he tells me he is done. \u00a0 There are forty-two &#8220;canon&#8221; Oz books in total.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been working on the New Jedi Order series that encompasses the Star Wars extended universe. \u00a0I used to buy all the Star Wars books as they came out. \u00a0 Somewhere between 1997 and 1999 I stopped. \u00a0 I just lost the interest for that time. \u00a0 When I decided to get back into it I chose the NJO because it was one of the most highly acclaimed Star Wars series I missed. \u00a0 I started these also in December and I&#8217;m on the eleventh book of the nineteen book series. \u00a0 This is put on hold about two weeks ago \u00a0since Lex\u00a0accidentally broke my Kindle case. \u00a0I don&#8217;t have a book light so I stopped reading these before bed.<\/p>\n<p>I took a side track for a few days in January when I worked the first ninety-three issues of <em>The Walking Dead<\/em>. \u00a0The comic series blows away the television show. \u00a0The story is much more engaging. \u00a0It is also completely different in some ways. \u00a0The television show is like an echo of the comic. \u00a0 It is not quite complete with a bitter hollowness that existed only in the original.<\/p>\n<p>Last week I read through <em>11\/22\/63<\/em> which is Stephen King&#8217;s time travel novel. \u00a0I had not read any King with the exception of the Dark Tower series since <em>Insomnia<\/em> came out. \u00a0 King is a great writer and storyteller. \u00a0I have never liked the fact that his book endings always seem rushed and hollow. \u00a0 The journey through this book was fantastic, but the ending was logically rushed. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about the ending. \u00a0 <em>Under the Dome<\/em> by King is one of the books I&#8217;m also working through. \u00a0 We will se how that ends.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday \u00a0finished up <em>Shadows in Flight<\/em>. \u00a0It is the latest book in the <em>Ender&#8217;s Game Universe<\/em>. \u00a0It was a short read. \u00a0It took less than two hours without giving it undivided attention. \u00a0 I love everything in the Enderverse, this one just felt a bit anti-climactic. \u00a0The ending also didn&#8217;t put me in a happy place. \u00a0 This book was designed to set up another book coming out this summer. \u00a0 I&#8217;m happy that I got something, but I&#8217;m not sure I got what I wanted from this book.<\/p>\n<p>Currently in rotation of being read as the already mentioned <em>Kabumpo in Oz<\/em>, <em>Under the Dome<\/em>, and the Eleventh NJO book. \u00a0 I&#8217;m also working through The <em>Steve Jobs<\/em> and <em>Wicked<\/em> (though Wicked has been in the works of being read before I started reading more in December). \u00a0 \u00a0I swear there is two to three more books I&#8217;ve read, but for some reason <a href=\"http:\/\/goodreads.com\">Goodreads<\/a> is not displaying them properly. \u00a0 It didn&#8217;t even display <em>11\/22\/63<\/em> until I hunted for it and confirmed I had marked it as read. \u00a0It just wasn&#8217;t displaying on my read list. \u00a0If I hadn&#8217;t just entered it last week it wouldn&#8217;t have been fresh in my mind that I put it in there.<\/p>\n<p>What about you?
