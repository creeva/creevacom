Seriously. When I was somewhere between four and six my mother won a radio contest where we got free tickets to see Barnum and Bailey&#8217;s Circus at the Richfield Coliseum. Part of this prize pack included the child being crowned King or the Circus &#8211; I also had a Queen of the Circus whose parental unit must have also won a contest. I don&#8217;t know where my queen is, we haven&#8217;t kept in touch.<\/p>\n<p>The memory is fuzzy, but I remember being taken down and sitting at the sidelines for a little bit with the circus performers. I was then put on a little train (next to the queen) and taken on a circle of the Coliseum and waving to the whole crowd of thousands. At the time it was the greatest day of my life (the worst day was finding out I was no longer going to be an only child). They cheered and I got to take home my cape (I told you I had thing with capes) and a crown.<\/p>\n<p>I was as high as a kite and bragged to all of my friends over the next year that I was king of the circus &#8211; at the time I even had pictures to prove that &#8211; so take that disbelievers (for all modern disbelievers the pictures are now lost so please suspend your disbelief, thank you). Life was good and I was king. Nothing could knock me off my thrown until the following summer.<\/p>\n<p>The following summer the news announced it was going to do a little piece on the Barnum and Bailey circus coming back to town. I thought &#8220;great I&#8217;ll go back and ride on my throne again&#8221;. However, during the piece the newscasters showed another kid wearing the crown and taking the tour. HOW COULD THEY? USURPER TO THE THRONE PREPARE TO MEET STEEL!!! I went to the back room of my grandmothers house and put on my crown and cried. I think I through away that crown that day too.<\/p>\n<p>The situation had to then be explained to me &#8211; I was not happy.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t hold a grudge though.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t been to the Barnum and Bailey&#8217;s Circus since.<\/p>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t hold a grudge.<\/p>\n<p>Bastards.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/1344115235_13948a8c6d_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"162\" height=\"240\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Picture from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/85128884@N00\/1344115235\/\">here<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here I was King of the Circus.
