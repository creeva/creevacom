they routed off of an anonymous proxy which showed they lived in Britain. \u00a0 They didn&#8217;t actually live in Britain, the servers just thought they did. \u00a0 They watched the games live without commercial breaks. \u00a0 If I had not been at work I&#8217;m sure I would have watched this way. \u00a0 Later that night I just watched most of the performances via a live stream (I don&#8217;t get a TV signal at my house).<\/p>\n<p>The IOC and NBC were playing whack-a-mole with these livestreams. \u00a0I know at least two of the ones I was using got cut off during the openings. \u00a0 When a third was removed shortly before the parade of nations, I just stopped and moved to watching streaming television shows. \u00a0 At least the livestream I was watching had commercials &#8211; my netflix, no commercials. \u00a0 Essentially NBC lost eyeballs for cutting this viewership off &#8211; all in the name of copyright.<\/p>\n<p>The IOC know that some people really want to see the games. \u00a0 This is why they sell off media rights to outlets in different countries to the tune of millions of dollars. \u00a0 They also sell off the rights to host the games, which also costs cities millions of dollars of infrastructure that usually goes to waste after the games. \u00a0 This is so the city can cash in on all the visitors that come to see the Olympics.<\/p>\n<p>The IOC does provide the medals, those I&#8217;m sure this is a fraction of the money they receive into the organization. \u00a0 They don&#8217;t even really have to advertise the games. \u00a0 Everyone knows the games happen every four years. \u00a0 The stations and cities that won the bids pump millions into advertising for the games. \u00a0 Once again the cost to the IOC is nothing.<\/p>\n<p>It costs you though. \u00a0 If you were attending the Olympics, unless you have press credentials, you don&#8217;t own the copyright to any video or picture you take. \u00a0 They have tried to limit texting and twitter use. \u00a0 They have banned the use of wireless hotspots at Olympic locations. \u00a0 Granted all this just causes mass data congestion, I&#8217;m sure the reception is terrible. \u00a0 This is because the IOC is trying to maintain control.<\/p>\n<p>The IOC doesn&#8217;t want to break the contract it made with NBC to show the commercials and make millions of dollars, just because some guy at the swim meet is Ustreaming the event. \u00a0Let&#8217;s look for a moment though, the original Olympics were not about making money.<\/p>\n<p>We will skip the ancient Greece part and move forward to the modern Olympics which started in 1821. \u00a0After the first revival the Olympics struggled to get traction. \u00a0People were not interested in them. \u00a0 They moved it forward as a method to promote world peace. \u00a0 Why should we be killing each other when we can do\u00a0synchronized\u00a0swimming and get the gold. \u00a0 The gold is the equivalent as killing the competition.<\/p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until the last seventy years or so that the Olympic games even became a big deal. \u00a0 It was something people kind of knew about &#8211; but bring in the\u00a0advertisers. \u00a0Advertisers and broadcasters hyped up the game and made it a modern spectacle. \u00a0Instead of promoting countries to come together for a peaceful competition &#8211; it&#8217;s about making money now. \u00a0 The side effect is that\u00a0athletes\u00a0are competing. \u00a0 If they could make the same\u00a0money\u00a0without the athletes, NBC wouldn&#8217;t bother broadcasting at all.<\/p>\n<p>When I was little I think I only became aware of the Olympics because of Wheaties. \u00a0I think it might have taken a few more years if it wasn&#8217;t for the commercials featuring this random gold medalist that was going to be on the box. \u00a0My whole life it has been about commercialism. \u00a0It shouldn&#8217;t be.<\/p>\n<p>If this is for peace and coming together all the content should be retained by whoever films it. \u00a0It should also be filmed by everyone. \u00a0 Governments should have an official stream that they offer to its citizens. \u00a0 It&#8217;s our tax money that builds the games infrastructure. \u00a0It is out tax money that trains and sends our athletes to the games. \u00a0 We pay extra cost by being subjected to advertising and delayed screening of events. \u00a0The games are something that should belong to us all. \u00a0 Something that is apart of our national heritage has been stripped away for commercialization.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
