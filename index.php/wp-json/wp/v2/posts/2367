do have to know HTML, but content providers have been long past the time when HTML skills were required. \u00a0 If my sister wanted to start a blog, she wouldn&#8217;t bother to learn HTML.\u00a0 If my grandmother got to the point where she decided that she wanted to post her recipes online she would be discouraged by ever looking at HTML code.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing HTML is a benefit but not a necessity.\u00a0 It also is not simple pie publishing that anyone can learn and understand. \u00a0 It&#8217;s understanding the logic and taking the time to learn the codes. \u00a0 This time takes away from the ability to actually create content for a creator (if their creation is not strictly or primarily HTML). \u00a0 People waste time on things they don&#8217;t need to when learning a good CMS system would be sufficient.\u00a0\u00a0 The next step if you had to learn something would be CSS to style the CMS system the way you want it to look.\u00a0\u00a0 Then at this point learning HTML may be a benefit.<\/p>\n<p>The teachers however train you that HTML is the first thing you have to learn. \u00a0 They waste time on skills that may never be relevant. \u00a0 Unfortunately, these skills are a complete waste of time and are lost in relevancy immediately when they start to put those skills into practical use. \u00a0 The similar scenario that I can put into the educator&#8217;s false belief in this system is similar to how programming was when I was in school. \u00a0 When I went to college in the 1995 school season the major programming language at the time was C++ for the computing community. \u00a0 The highest level of programming my college taught CS majors was PASCAL. \u00a0 PASCAL was on the way out as a programming language at the time.\u00a0 Already it had seen its heyday and was in decline. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not arguing that it wasn&#8217;t an important skill to learn, I am however wondering how that skill would have gotten me a job.<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, I never took a computer programming class at college. \u00a0 I also have never taken an HTML class, but I&#8217;ve used the web successfully and created varying levels of content on it since 1994. \u00a0\u00a0 These skills are also not in my skill set for work either.\u00a0\u00a0 Though I work in computer security I&#8217;m not a programmer nor do I ever plan to be. \u00a0\u00a0 I started programming with the original &#8220;anyone can learn it&#8221; programming language, BASIC.<\/p>\n<p>I hated BASIC on my VIC-20 with a passion.\u00a0 Anything to do with typos took hours to correct after taking hours to input in the first place. \u00a0 This early interaction made me hate programming with a passion. \u00a0 My brother however at least embraced HTML and web design technologies. \u00a0 This will help make him a web architect, but not a content provider. \u00a0 HTML is for the rigid people that like order.\u00a0 They make sense out of the chaos. \u00a0 Content creators on the other hand learn enough web languages to make their content viewable. \u00a0 Creators are much more chaotic than designers.<\/p>\n<p>I am a creator and I say HTML is overhyped. \u00a0 It does allow me to be more flexible in some areas, but that&#8217;s only to bring some order to the chaos. \u00a0 I prefer to start with the chaos and work from there.<\/p>\n<p>We could always go back to the myth that you need to understand math to use computers, but that&#8217;s a rant for another day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For years there has been a myth going around online.\u00a0 The detrimental myth hurts many and makes them feel inferior.\u00a0\u00a0 The myth is that HTML is very easy.\u00a0 I read many books on the history &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":96082,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2367"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2367"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2367\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/96082"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2367"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2367"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2367"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
