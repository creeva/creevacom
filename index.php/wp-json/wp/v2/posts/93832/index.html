Everything was right in the world and we all moved on.<\/p>\n<p>Fast-forward to this last weekend. I get five emails stating that five different pieces I have uploaded to <a href=\"http:\/\/scribd.com\">Scribd<\/a> have been flagged as copy-written works and removed. The pieces were all 1910 or earlier, so they were all in the public domain. I posted them to make the pieces easier to find. I fired back an email on each item &#8211; and nothing. Last time around I received a &#8220;here is your ticket number, we will contact you &#8211; etc.&#8221; So earlier today I fired off another email, and still nothing.<\/p>\n<p>So it seems all you need to do is claim a copyright on the Scribd platform and immediately becomes yours. Public domain be damned. It&#8217;s not like they haven&#8217;t run into this issues before *cough*. Until then I sit here and wait while the trolls overreach their authority and get public domain pieces removed. I will follow up when I hear from them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; About two and a half years ago I found myself in the middle of a copyright claim over Huckleberry Finn (and my amusing to me edit of this public domain novel).
