Thursday night when I arrive\u00a0home and start unpacking \u00a0I noticed something about the costume. \u00a0 Instead of the medium they had, I grabbed the large. \u00a0 There was no way he was going to fit into the costume. \u00a0 I couldn&#8217;t return it and we had to tell Lex that he was back to being Kylo Ren. \u00a0We will save the Pumpkin Head and hopefully he might be able to make it workable next year.<\/p>\n<p>His trick or treating at the campground went off without a hitch. \u00a0 He loved his Kylo costume. \u00a0We were a bit worried since because of timing we shipped him off with Grandma and Grandpa without ever doing a test fitting. \u00a0Lex decided\u00a0when city wide trick or treating occurred (tomorrow) that he would be Kylo again.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94557\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/41YqAaSgcJL-1-130x300.jpg\" alt=\"41YqAaSgcJL\" width=\"130\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/41YqAaSgcJL-1-130x300.jpg 130w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/41YqAaSgcJL-1.jpg 217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 130px) 100vw, 130px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Heroes-Deluxe-Muscle-Superman-Costume\/dp\/B000P58GCE\/ref=sr_1_2?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1446047284&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=kids+superman+costume\">Found link to the costume here<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday we found out that he would have his school Halloween party this Friday. \u00a0 We ran into a snag. \u00a0 Anything he wore to school could not be violent, it could not have a mask, and he could not wear makeup. \u00a0 This put Kylo Ren and a salvaged Pumpkin Head from being used at all. \u00a0 There was a couple of discussions of what to dress up as. \u00a0 The first was Doctor Who &#8211; which would be going out and buying more pieces to make it workable. \u00a0The second was Marty McFly, Lex had worn that outfit out shopping last weekend for the heck of it. \u00a0 Lex however came up with the final solution.<\/p>\n<p>Lex insisted he had a Superman costume upstairs. \u00a0He had one in the past, but we were pretty sure that he had outgrown it. \u00a0 He was insistent though. \u00a0 Yesterday we were prepared to go out on costume trail (once more into the breach), but if he had a costume that would work he should go try it on before we went any further. \u00a0 It turns out as part of the clearance sales last year, he did have a fitting and working Superman costume.<\/p>\n<p>If for some reason this is considered &#8220;violent&#8221; by the school, I&#8217;m prepared to object. \u00a0Superman is the biggest Boy Scout in the comic book universe. \u00a0 His other costumes have masks &#8211; and even if we tried to spin the Kylo costume as a simple Dark Jedi, he would still be more violent than Superman. \u00a0You never know though in this day and age. \u00a0 Earlier this year there was <a href=\"http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Lifestyle\/school-reportedly-bans-girls-woman-lunchbox\/story?id=33382842\">a story going around about a girl&#8217;s lunchbox being banned because it Wonder Woman on it<\/a>.\u00a0\u00a0Lex has a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle backpack and lunchbox he takes to school everyday. \u00a0 If they raise an eyebrow I&#8217;ll point to all the other comic book characters that are more violent that adorn kids clothes and backpacks everyday. \u00a0 I think though, that we will be fine.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s hope next year is an easier one when it comes to costume. \u00a0 We do still have the Pumpkin Head&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The look I should have given halfway through This year and costumes for my son&#8230;.
