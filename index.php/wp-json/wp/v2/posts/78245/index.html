I would say without pausing that it is my favorite ride in the park. I liked it as a kid, but as a teenager I rode it over and over. Multiple times <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2012\/02\/22\/cedar-point-memories-part-2\/\" class=\"broken_link\">my friend (who stole the tokens)<\/a> and I would go to the park to just ride the Paddlewheel. Another one of our friends was dating the captain (Captain D), so we learned all about the ride and just hung out with him.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sadly Captain D was fired for smoking pot after hours on the island in the middle of the ride. We never saw Captain D again. His memory did live on in the Vermilion Crazy Craft race when we named out boat &#8220;Captain D&#8217;s Final Voyage&#8221;. We did get first place for design.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ever since that summer riding the Paddlewheel has always been an obsession. I loved being the heckler and getting to know the captains. I also only heckled the captains that play along with it. I&#8217;m not completely a troll.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sadly, last season was the Paddlewheel&#8217;s last year. I didn&#8217;t know, otherwise I would have made a special day to Cedar Point, just riding the Paddlewheel over and over and over again. The final two voyages they auctioned off for charity. I so would have spent hundreds of dollars for the opportunity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before my son was born I considered man times applying to Cedar Point just for this job on the weekends. Captain Creeva just has a great sound to it. We almost went to the park on my birthday and Xie was going to see if they would allow me to do the stand up for at least one time through. We sadly didn&#8217;t go, and I think I chickened out.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The final effect that the ride had on has made reverberation nine years later. When <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/02\/29\/intrepids-history-an-entertainers-farewell\/\" class=\"broken_link\">I made an entertainer in Star Wars Galaxies<\/a>. For this character I invented the name &#8220;Creeva&#8221;. He used corny jokes in the paddlewheel captain fashion.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Did you hear about the new server at the Bestine Cantina? His name is Darth Waiter.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I even contemplated doing planetary tours in the paddlewheel style. Unfortunately it never came to pass. Of course this lead to my blog&#8217;s name, twitter handle, etc.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I can&#8217;t truly express how much I will miss this ride. It was an important of my teenage years. It was fascination over of something so simple and fun that made it great. When I had friends that didn&#8217;t like the ride, normally I could turn them around. Some of them also became marathon rides. It was a great time and with the loss of the ride, it is truly the end of an era.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/6023814827_dbdb840ef6-1-1.jpg\" class=\"broken_link\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83932\" title=\"6023814827_dbdb840ef6\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/6023814827_dbdb840ef6-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You guys are BY FAR, the MOST recent group I&#8217;ve had today.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone please scoot to the left of your bench&#8230; now to the right&#8230; to the front of your seat&#8230; now to the back&#8230; Thanks guys, it was my day to polish the benches!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/3869552738_9231732a16-1-1.jpg\" class=\"broken_link\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-83921\" title=\"3869552738_9231732a16\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/3869552738_9231732a16-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Look at that sign folks.
