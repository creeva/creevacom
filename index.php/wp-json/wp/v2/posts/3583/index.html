Well this girl was a lot like my mother. She was very bossy and wanted things a certain way. She cared about the appearance of things and not the reality. I don&#8217;t want to hash everything I wrote in the other post here again, so I won&#8217;t. Read the link if you want ot hear more about her.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, during that whole on again off again relationship, I managed to essentially date and live with a girl just like mom. It was the relationship from hell, and I&#8217;m sure part of me deserved it. The best thing is after the relationship was over and I was with my future wife I saw how much that girl was like my mother. It also made me realize how much I&#8217;m like my father. So in turn I realized how much it was never going to work out.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe my anger towards my ex bleeds over to the anger I have my mother (or vice versa). Who knows.<\/p>\n<p>This wasn&#8217;t meant to be a long post, but more of one stating that I did not marry a girl just like mom. I just dated one.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/01\/a-month-of-mom-part-1-the-background\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 1 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/02\/a-month-of-mom-part-2-the-end-is-the-beginning\/ \" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 2 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/month-of-mom-part-3-back-in-ohio\/ \" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 3 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/04\/month-of-mom-part-4-still-in-ohio\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 4 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/05\/a-month-with-mom-part-5-you-cant-help-those-that-dont-help-themselves\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 5 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/06\/a-month-with-mom-part-6-shop-a-holic\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 6 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/07\/a-month-with-mom-part-7-respect-is-a-two-way-street\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 7 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/08\/a-month-with-mom-part-8-in-oregon\/ \" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 8 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/09\/a-month-with-mom-part-9-favortism\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 9 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-10-do-these-curtains-make-me-look-fat\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 10 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/11\/a-month-with-mom-part-11-keeping-up-with-the-jones\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 11 here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-12-gossip-girl\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 12 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-13-talking-behind-the-back\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 13 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-14-father-issues\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 14 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-15-if-you-have-it-im-entitled-also\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 15 Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/11\/03\/a-month-with-mom-part-16-dealing-with-the-ex\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Read Part 16 Here<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This one is a day late&#8230;&#8230; A few months ago I wrote about the girl that was my longest relationship before my wife.
