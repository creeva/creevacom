Well this girl was a lot like my mother. She was very bossy and wanted things a certain way. She cared about the appearance of things and not the reality. I don&#8217;t want to hash everything I wrote in the other post here again, so I won&#8217;t. Read the link if you want ot hear more about her.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, during that whole on again off again relationship, I managed to essentially date and live with a girl just like mom. It was the relationship from hell, and I&#8217;m sure part of me deserved it. The best thing is after the relationship was over and I was with my future wife I saw how much that girl was like my mother. It also made me realize how much I&#8217;m like my father. So in turn I realized how much it was never going to work out.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe my anger towards my ex bleeds over to the anger I have my mother (or vice versa). Who knows.<\/p>\n<p>This wasn&#8217;t meant to be a long post, but more of one stating that I did not marry a girl just like mom. I just dated one.<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 2 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 3 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 4 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 5 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 6 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 7 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 8 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 9 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 10 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 11 here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 12 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 13 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 14 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 15 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 16 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This one is a day late&#8230;&#8230; A few months ago I wrote about the girl that was my longest relationship before my wife.
