I will first admit I have not checked the forums, but I have checked their blog. So this is irritating for a company that I&#8217;ve placed accolades on top of in my continuing quest to sync and simplify my life.<\/p>\n<p>The issue I am having is all of my contacts of disappeared. I first noticed this on Thursday last week and I let it go considering it was a temporary glitch or my browser didn&#8217;t render the page properly. My calendar was still working so I was happy at the time.<\/p>\n<p>I logged in today though and my calendar was still working, but still no contacts. No contact means their new &#8220;social network&#8221; called Pulse is completely useless also. Now, normally this wouldn&#8217;t be a big deal to me since I&#8217;ve dealt with other minor issues with Plaxo in the past. But I had to re-authenticate yahoo today in my account and then I hoped my contacts would re-populate &#8211; they did not. So theoretically all contacts population (the pudding in the Plaxo pie) is now broken for my account.<\/p>\n<p>The other sync points I use &#8211; outlook, google, yahoo, MSN, and aim are all up to date with each other. So my data may not be centralized but it is up to date. I&#8217;ll give them another week or so to decide if this &#8220;hub&#8221; is worth using if I can&#8217;t get to it for my central need. This issue is highly annoying but not devastating in my life as a whole since I still have the information. This may however make me rethink giving Plaxo the second chance I did give it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve done a few posts saying the virtues of Plaxo.
