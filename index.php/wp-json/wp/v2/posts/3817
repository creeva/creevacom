that if I could handle the call in under five minutes and be almost positive that they wouldn&#8217;t be calling in on the same issue that I could just skip the ticket process.\u00a0\u00a0 So for volume, by the time I left I handled far above and beyond what everyone else had ever handled.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Symantec has since dicontinued the product, it lasted about another year and half after I migrated into consulting that it went kaput.\u00a0 I wonder if anyone caught up to me in the call record or number of handled cases before it was gone.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t about bragging rights, I&#8217;m sure it sounds like it though.\u00a0\u00a0 What did both of these jobs have in common though?\u00a0 They were both hectic chicken running with it&#8217;s head cut off problem squashing affairs.\u00a0\u00a0 I work best where I have a new issue every fifteen minutes or a nagging issue that would keep me up at night trying to solve.\u00a0\u00a0 As you move up the ladder you loose that.\u00a0 You are working on long and engaging projects where the problem takes five minutes to engineer, yet in turn takes six months to implement.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m still good at what I do, but it&#8217;s not exactly the best fit for my skill set.\u00a0\u00a0 This in turn leads me into a spiral or more money versus more enjoyment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Me and my Grandfather (Not a Recent Picture)<\/p>\n<p>I had a conversation with my grandfather a few weeks ago, he told me how lucky it was that I had a job in today&#8217;s economy (I am), and that it would be difficult to move up in the area I lived.\u00a0 I started to explain to him that I could more then likely finding a better paying job, but it may not be as stable in the long term as my current one.\u00a0\u00a0 I also said for the right job I would work for less then I currently do.\u00a0 Somehow in his mind that didn&#8217;t compute.\u00a0\u00a0 In an abstraction of what he said, essentially he thought climbing the ladder should be what is important.\u00a0\u00a0 I told him with the right job, I would take a 20% pay reduction.\u00a0 Granted that wasn&#8217;t my end goal, but for the right job in the right environment I would take my family down to the bare level where we could maintain everything.\u00a0\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 I would be happier.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>We are taught early that you need to learn so you can better then&#8221;random example&#8221;.\u00a0\u00a0 So you can go to college and maintain that edge and not be a janitor.\u00a0\u00a0 So you can get the huge house and be better then your neighbors.\u00a0\u00a0 If you neighbor buys a Lexus you are taught that you should buy a BMW.\u00a0 It&#8217;s a mad dash to prove that your better then everyone else.\u00a0\u00a0 To prove that capitalism runs the world.\u00a0 If we are not working to that we are either considered un-American, stupid, or lazy.\u00a0\u00a0 Granted I am a bit lazy, but I can work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was born July 4, 1976 so I don&#8217;t consider myself un-American (I&#8217;m a Constitutionalist).\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m not stupid either.<\/p>\n<p>I think this mindset first hit my family when I wanted to go to college for music performance and creative writing.\u00a0\u00a0 They always said I wouldn&#8217;t make any money with that.\u00a0 I was seventeen and brave enough to say that if I was happy I could be living on a street corner in a box as long I was writing and playing music.\u00a0\u00a0 They never understood that.\u00a0 If I didn&#8217;t have my wife, and a love for electronics (I didn&#8217;t have that love back then), I could probably still do it.\u00a0\u00a0 My life hasn&#8217;t greatly changed at the core in the last decade though when I was first with my wife.\u00a0\u00a0 We live essentially the same way, we have a few nicer things, a house, a car payment &#8211; but our basic lives are still the same.\u00a0 I&#8217;d say the greatest difference is that we can not stand hamburger helper anymore.\u00a0\u00a0 I still eat the occasional cheap ass boil it\u00a0 ramen, and she enjoys Kraft Macaroni and Cheese still.<\/p>\n<p>Too many people in this world work for money.\u00a0\u00a0 Money is needed to survive (I have a friend that would argue that), but at the same time it shouldn&#8217;t be your singular goal.\u00a0\u00a0 When I was younger I had a certain goal financially I wanted to make, I did through different means.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m not at that level right now (I have no stock options to sell anymore), but it didn&#8217;t make it me any happier.\u00a0\u00a0 These days I write more, I play in two bands, I&#8217;m learning new instruments, and I have a baby that should arrive in the next couple months.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m juggling the things that make me happy with work, what if I could be blissful with my job too?\u00a0 Some days I hate my job, most the time I&#8217;m just meh.\u00a0\u00a0 If I could get the hair pulling problem solving hectic life going again it would be great (must be my undiagnosed ADD).\u00a0 If I could do it at the same pay level or better, that would be awesome.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I really need to get some more recent pictures of myself<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here Money isn&#8217;t everything.\u00a0\u00a0 We treat it like is though.\u00a0\u00a0 Some people can&#8217;t understand when I say I don&#8217;t necessarily want more though.\u00a0\u00a0 I of course do want more money, but at the &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3817"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3817"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3817\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3817"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3817"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3817"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
