I&#8217;m not going to make as much money as he does, I&#8217;m not going to get as many followers as he does, and I&#8217;m not going to ever get to play with all the toys he does, and I&#8217;ll never have his connections. So how am I going to outdo him?<\/p>\n<p>Data distribution.<\/p>\n<p>Last week someone asked me how I distribute my data across the Internet, at first I grabbed a piece of paper. After starting the diagram I realized it was way too inefficient in space requirements, so I moved on to a piece of poster board. After I had a rough diagram I was told I must surely be kidding. I assure you when it comes to my blog I never kid and don&#8217;t call me Shirley.<\/p>\n<p>After relaying this story to a friend he said he would be interested in how I distribute my data. So I put this challenge on myself, to come up with an accurate diagram of how I push my data and include passive inclusion in sites like google at the same time. The goal is to see how much data I truly generate with each post. Instead of just ramping up to include everything I&#8217;ve joined so far I&#8217;m taking it up a notch. I&#8217;m going to see how truly far I can push the envelope on passing this data and making it grow. Sort of a tsunami of Internet data.<\/p>\n<p>I will only have one account per service and stick with their own functionality, I won&#8217;t do any data passing manually, nor will I use a second account (since that&#8217;s cheating). If I managed to spam my data to 5000 Twitter accounts who would subscribe to any of them? No one, so I have to take the point of view I&#8217;ve always stated, this is about distributing data to my friends no matter what service they are on. It&#8217;s kind of the opposite of data portability, so with that in mind I&#8217;m calling this the data pushability project.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to continue until July 1st to see how many services I can link, crosspost, and pull in unique data from that either I create or I theoretically own (comments to my posts I have a stake in and much as my del.icio.us bookmarks). I want all the sites to automatically handle the data and use tools provided to me by web services. I&#8217;m targetting social networks and the like, but my friend asked me what am I going to do when the social network craze is over. I explained that this is more proof of concept and Internet distribution. Those are the factors that ring my bell, the friends and popularity contest really isn&#8217;t my driving factor. Getting my stuff read, that&#8217;s what I want. I don&#8217;t care if you friend me or not.<\/p>\n<p>So look forward to a diagram the first week of July that shows how far data can really be pushed in today&#8217;s Internet era.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What do I mean by out Scoble, Scoble himself?
