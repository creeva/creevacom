Just something to share between friends. &nbsp;I travel at least a week a month so I normally have an overview of some type of car. &nbsp; I spend four days driving it and get an overview of how the car performs and feels. &nbsp; I&#8217;ve decided to move these reviews over to my personal blog for better showing any images I may have, and let&#8217;s be fair, the interface to writing on WordPress is so much better than the writing interface used by Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>During the last week of March I drove a Ford Focus Hatchback. &nbsp; The last time I was in one of these was back in 2002. &nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t a fan then, and this current trip didn&#8217;t convince i need to trade in for one today. &nbsp;In all fairness though, I&#8217;m a bit biased. &nbsp; I&#8217;m not a Ford fan at all. &nbsp; This comes from growing up in a town where everyone worked for Ford. &nbsp; Since everyone worked at Ford (except my family), everyone drove a Ford. &nbsp;I was burnt out even before I was a driver. &nbsp;Since becoming a driver, my impression hasn&#8217;t been turned around.<\/p>\n<p>The Ford Focus they gave me was the five door hatchback. &nbsp; It has the problems that I have with most small cars, it seems jittery. &nbsp;After getting accustomed to either large cars or sports cars &#8211; compact cars seem a bit unsure of themselves. &nbsp; I&#8217;ve owned compact cars &#8211; so this is par for the course. &nbsp; While I don&#8217;t like, &nbsp;have owned them. &nbsp; So if this is your preference, it is par for the course.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94953\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.01-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-30 12.26.01\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.01-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.01-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.01-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.01-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.01-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>During my driving (almost all in-town and rare highway) I was getting about 31 MPG. &nbsp; My normal car (Dodge Charger AWD V8) get&#8217;s about 22 MPG in the same environment. &nbsp; My 2004 Miata was still getting 30MPG with over 100k on the odometer. &nbsp; I honestly was expecting to get closer to 38-40MPG. &nbsp; This is part of the problem when people consider small cars. &nbsp; Since smaller car rev higher &#8211; those higher RPMs use more gas. &nbsp; Now at cruising speed they will use less gas. &nbsp;However if the car is underpowered using the gas pedal to get up to speed will use more gas than maybe a car with a larger engine. &nbsp; Beyond tat initial acceleration a small engine will always use less gas if it is properly sized for the car. &nbsp;The one example I can turn to is the V6 2005 Grand Cherokee. &nbsp; This engine configuration actually get&#8217;s 2MPG less than the V8 configuration.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94959\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.21-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-30 12.26.21\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.21-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.21-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.21-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.21-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.21-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While it is a compact car the space in the rear seat is terrible. &nbsp; When i was growing up my family owned a few small cars. &nbsp;The back seat never seemed squished when I was growing up. &nbsp; However, this focus had the leg room in the back that would rival a third gen Camaro in the game who has the least amount of space. &nbsp; If you were thinking about getting one for a family, definitely pay attention to this.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94956\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.09-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2016-03-30 12.26.09\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.09-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.09-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.09-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.09-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/2016-03-30-12.26.09-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>My largest complaint though about the car is the gear shifter visual location. &nbsp; In the picture above the shifter looks like it is in Neutral. &nbsp; However, it is actually in Drive. &nbsp;The worst part about this (even though the picture washes out the D and the L) is that there is a Low&nbsp;below Drive. &nbsp; When I first pulled out the rental car location it was driving me nuts how high the engine was revving. &nbsp; This is when I discovered that the shifter looks to be in a higher position than it actually is. &nbsp; It could be the leather boot around it that obscures it&#8217;s actual position.<\/p>\n<p>Overall it&#8217;s a normal point A to point B car. &nbsp;Back in my very early twenties, that&#8217;s what I thought a car was for. &nbsp;I was a point A to B person for vehicles. &nbsp; Now they are extension of myself in so many ways. &nbsp; I appreciate this car what it is, a standard car without frills. &nbsp; It&#8217;s one of the first rental cars I&#8217;ve had where you can&#8217;t disable traction control (most the time you won&#8217;t see a difference in the compact whether that&#8217;s on or off). &nbsp;I did chirp the tires once getting out of someone&#8217;s way. &nbsp; Beyond that it was predictable and reliable without trying to overcompensate in anyway. &nbsp; That has it&#8217;s good and bad depending on what type of driver you are.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rental car reviews used to be something I wrote up on Facebook. &nbsp;
