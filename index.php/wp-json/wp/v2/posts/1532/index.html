After the first sentence, you are probably wondering what the title has to do with this post. Well, let&#8217;s get into that.<\/p>\n<p>Coming back from lunch one of my co-workers clarified that I was going to be married for nine years. I confirmed his statement. He then asked me why I wore shoes like I&#8217;m a high schooler still. For a moment I was taken aback.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get some things out of the way, this gentleman may not be old enough to be my grandfather, but he is older than my father. He has long hair in a ponytail. probably in his mid 50&#8217;s maybe pushing early 60;s &#8211; all in all age doesn&#8217;t matter to me much, he is a man like any other.<\/p>\n<p>For a moment I was just dumbfounded. I look down at his feet and he had brown wingtips on, but they were scuffed and aged for a few years. Something with dress shoes that I would never wear anything that beat up out in public for that shoe style. I used to always wear dress shoes when I was consulting, but since I&#8217;m in the office all day I wear something more befitting to my work and being on my feet more often then I was when I was consulting.<\/p>\n<p>How do you explain to this gentleman that I value my personal comfort when occasions allow for it than any false bravadoes of style? That generationally the wing tips don&#8217;t fit most people in their late 20&#8217;s early 30&#8217;s like they did twenty to thirty years ago. Fashion slaves no longer need to exist to the level in business that the older generation once believed. Even IBM employees don&#8217;t wear suits and ties to work anymore.<\/p>\n<p>I left it with that line that they were comfortable and that&#8217;s why I wear them. I didn&#8217;t add that my dress shoes don&#8217;t look like they are falling apart and 4 months past they need a good polishing.<\/p>\n<p>In the end &#8211; I don&#8217;t understand what that has to do with being married for 9 years.<\/p>\n<p>I assume these would be a more fitting style according to him for a guy married 9 years than the shoes pictured above (the style I normally buy):<\/p>\n<p>Ug.<\/p>\n<p>Anyways I&#8217;ve been happily married now for 9 short years and hopefully will stay that way into I&#8217;m just a memory in everyone&#8217;s eye and someone whose thoughts only exist in the archive.org Wayback machine.<\/p>\n<p>I love my wife with all of my heart, there are trials and tribulations that go with any marriage and being the same person for over a decade. However, we persevere and go one (though we still argue about copyright law &#8211; HEATEDLY). We will manage to get through and stay in blissful debate and wonderful marriage until our dying day.<\/p>\n<p>I will however still wear the shoes I like and not the ones befitting a certain age or social economic structure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The other day at work I had mentioned my 9th wedding anniversary coming up and of course, as per custom my co-workers congratulated me.
