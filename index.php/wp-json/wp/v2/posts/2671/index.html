This was important to me since going from here, to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.livejournal.com\">livejournal<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dandelife.com\">dandelife<\/a> pulls in the information for my timeline widget there. It&#8217;s all small and pretty much a petty thing, but it&#8217;s part of my broadcasting to friends on other social networks. I still need to figure out why my crossposting to my MSN space isn&#8217;t working. But all my other cross-posting functions are working.<\/p>\n<p>To fix this is issue the WordPress <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/ljxp\/\">livejournal crosspost plugin<\/a>. I searched google and came across the blog &#8220;<span id=\"1go7\" class=\"VrHWId\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stevesmyth.net\/\">control, shift, cheesburge<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stevesmyth.net\/\">r<\/a>&#8221; where he had also had the issue after upgrading to WordPress 2.5. He was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stevesmyth.net\/archives\/181\">discussing in one of his posts<\/a> which plugins he had working and what wasn&#8217;t, he mentioned that he had to adjust the livejournal crosspost plugin by modifying a couple of lines. The only problem? He didn&#8217;t specify which lines. I posted a comment asking which he modified and thankfully he answered me. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>He stated he managed to get the information from a <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/ljxp\/issues\/detail?id=40\">google group about the plugin<\/a>. The line you need to adjust is the lines<\/p>\n<p><code>if(version_compare($wp_version, \"2.1\", \"&lt;\")) {<br \/>\nrequire_once(ABSPATH . '\/wp-includes\/template-functions-links.php');<br \/>\n}<\/code><br \/>\nNeed to be changed to:<\/p>\n<p><code>if(version_compare($wp_version, \"2.3\", \"&lt;\")) {<br \/>\nrequire_once(ABSPATH . '\/wp-includes\/link-template.php');<br \/>\n}<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, now you won&#8217;t have to look as hard for this fix.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cross-posting to my livejournal account has been fixed.
