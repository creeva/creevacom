Is this really a problem? From the unemployment we may notice it, but from access to upper-class yuppie coffee will we? I read yesterday that someone in Portland, OR had 23 stores within 2 miles of their house. <a href=\"http:\/\/justinblanton.com\/2005\/01\/star\">This guy has 43 within 5 miles<\/a> and reports the highest density they have found is 170 stores around Broadway Ave in New York City.<\/p>\n<p>When I was growing up I thought a Mcdonald&#8217;s at every other exit on the highway was dense growth for a store or business. Now that may as well be freaking no man&#8217;s land as far as Starbucks is concerned. If you cut down half of all the stores around the three locations I mentioned earlier &#8211; that is 110 stores right there, so 1\/6 of the number of stores to close and that will still leave an insane amount of density for those residents. Don&#8217;t expect me to pity you if you have to walk another 100 yards because the Starbucks closest to you is closed. It does mean however you are a bad person that didn&#8217;t frequent your closest Starbucks enough to they decided you weren&#8217;t worth sticking around for to deliver coffee goodness to &#8211; remember that when you walk that extra 3 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>I once read that they could build a Walmart five miles from another Walmart and both would still be profitable. I think in the old Starbucks regime is that they could build a new Starbucks five feet from another Starbucks and still be profitable. It seems that old thinking was wrong and now all Starbucks must be a minimum of 15.3 feet from one another.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here Starbucks is closing 600 stores and laying off 12,000 people according to Reuters reporting.
