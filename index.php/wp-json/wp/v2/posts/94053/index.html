I had a PDF that was encrypted by a third-party certificate that I had to install on my system. Once the certificate was installed, I could view the document &#8211; but only in the official Adobe Acrobat reader.<\/p>\n<p>I needed to get this over to my iPad, but I was not going to install the key (even if that is possible) onto my tablet. I could print, but I could not use the built-in OSX print to PDF feature. This feature is blocked by Adobe Acrobat reader. I couldn&#8217;t strip it of protections, since it used a third-party encryption. I couldn&#8217;t copy and paste the information out into Word &#8211; because Acrobat Reader blocked that. I did manage to get the information though.<\/p>\n<p>In the windows world, there are many print to PDF drivers. In retrospect, this might have been faster if I just had jumped to a Windows system. I needed a method to make Acrobat Reader believe I was printing to an real printer. I found <a href=\"http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/pdfwriterformac\/\">PDFwriter on Sourceforge<\/a> that was just what I needed. This registers as any other printer and allows you to print to pdf directly, even with a protected document.<\/p>\n<p>It installed easily and the print process seemed to work. Unfortunately I had no idea where the output was saved. The configuration file didn&#8217;t seem to have any settings on this. In windows I normally expect a save-as dialogue. This printed and then went away. I had to go back to the readme.pdf file that was included, and found my answer:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Simply print your documents using <span class=\"s1\">PDFwriter <\/span>as your printer. The PDF files will be stored\u00a0in the directory <span class=\"s1\">\/Users\/Shared\/PDFwriter<\/span>. There&#8217;s a folder with your user name which\u00a0contains your printed documents. ( to go to \/Users\/Shared\/PDFwriter please open Finder,\u00a0<span class=\"s2\">select your <\/span>Macintosh HD <span class=\"s2\">and then go into <\/span>Users <span class=\"s2\">&#8211; <\/span>Shared <span class=\"s2\">&#8211; <\/span>PDFwriter<span class=\"s2\">)<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hopefully this helps someone else out. You also should be able to do the same thing on Windows.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; This is just a quick tech note for those that might be fighting an encrypted PDF on OSX.
