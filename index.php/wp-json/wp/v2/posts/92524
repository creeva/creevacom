\u00a0Well, it&#8217;s all because of this song:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When Worlds Collide&#8221; was included on the game soundtrack. &nbsp; Sometimes we would just constantly reset the level until we got this song. &nbsp;It was such a pump up song for us that we actually did better with it. &nbsp; Eventually we just started listening to CD&#8217;s (remember those kids?). &nbsp;We played Slipknot or Limp Bizkit. &nbsp;Though I&#8217;m not sure how often any single track compares to &#8220;When Worlds Collide&#8221; in actual times I have listened to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This takes us back to this morning and driving into work. \u00a0 &#8220;When Worlds Collide&#8221; came up on my iPhone. \u00a0 As I&#8217;m listening to it. \u00a0 I can literally just see playing the game. \u00a0 I can see the tricks and the levels. \u00a0 It transports me to a different time. \u00a0 Other times when I have listened to the song I&#8217;ve actually moved my thumbs like I was playing. \u00a0 \u00a0This is Pavlovian conditioning at its finest. \u00a0 I also don&#8217;t regret a moment of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been playing also on my iPad lately. \u00a0 The lack of tactile feedback that the touchscreen has is just not the same. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not doing badly working all the characters through it, but my\u00a0play style\u00a0is much different from it was with a controller. \u00a0 The iOS version has a different soundtrack. \u00a0I usually play it with the game muted. \u00a0I guess that&#8217;s a good thing, I don&#8217;t need to be conditioned for any more songs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your curious this is the track list from the Playstation game soundtrack:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. &#8220;Papa Roach &#8211; Blood Brothers&#8221;<br>2. &#8220;Anthrax featuring Chuck D. of Public Enemy &#8211; Bring The Noise&#8221;<br>3. &#8220;Rage Against the Machine &#8211; Guerrilla Radio&#8221;<br>4. &#8220;Naughty by Nature &#8211; Pin the Tail on the Donkey&#8221;<br>5. &#8220;Bad Religion &#8211; You&#8221;<br>6. &#8220;Powerman 5000 &#8211; When Worlds Collide&#8221;<br>7. &#8220;Millencolin &#8211; No Cigar&#8221;<br>8. &#8220;The High and Mighty featuring Mos Def &amp; Mad Skillz &#8211; B-Boy Document 99&#8221;<br>9. &#8220;Dub Pistols &#8211; Cyclone&#8221;<br>10. &#8220;Lagwagon &#8211; May 16&#8221;<br>11. &#8220;Styles of Beyond &#8211; Subculture&#8221;<br>12. &#8220;Consumed &#8211; Heavy Metal Winner&#8221;<br>13. &#8220;Alley Life featuring Black Planet &#8211; Out With the Old&#8221;<br>14. &#8220;Swingin&#8217; Utters &#8211; Five Lessons Learned&#8221;<br>15. &#8220;Fu Manchu &#8211; Evil Eye&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll end this with a video I found on YouTube of the last level in THPS2:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><\/center>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here is a basic refresher on Pavlov for those that have forgotten. \u00a0Pavlov was a famous psychologist who that proved with repetition a response could be conditioned. \u00a0He was investigating the salivary glands in dogs. &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94373,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/92524"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=92524"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/92524\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94373"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=92524"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=92524"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=92524"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
