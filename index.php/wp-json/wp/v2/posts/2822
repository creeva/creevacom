Download and install the plugin<\/p>\n<p>2. Activate the plugin in your WordPress installation on your plugin tab<\/p>\n<p>3. Go to your settings tab and click on the live journal option<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0 Fill in the following options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>LiveJournal-compliant host:\u00a0 (<em>If you are using a LiveJournal-compliant site other than LiveJournal (like DeadJournal), enter the domain name here. LiveJournal users can use the default value<\/em>)<\/li>\n<li>LJ Username<\/li>\n<li>LJ Password<\/li>\n<li>Community: (<em>If you wish your posts to be copied to a community, enter the community name here. Leaving this space blank will copy the posts to the specified user&#8217;s journal instead<\/em>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That gives you the most basic configuration of this plugin, however, unlike many other wordpress plugins that would end there, Livejournal crossposter gives you a myriad of more options.\u00a0 Here are a few more things you can tweak:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crosspost header\/footer location &#8211; <em>choices at the top or bottom of the post<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Set blog name for crosspost header\/footer &#8211; <em>you can use your own blog&#8217;s title or a customer title<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Custom crosspost header\/footer &#8211; <em>gives you the option for custom coding in the header or footer<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Privacy level for all posts to LiveJournal &#8211; <em>choices are public, private, or friends<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Should comments be allowed on LiveJournal? &#8211; <em>You can force commentors to come back to your blog to comment or allow them to comment directly in livejournal (I just let them go directly onto live journal&#8217;s site)<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Tag entries on LiveJournal? &#8211; <em>Choices are -Tag LiveJournal entries with WordPress categories only, Tag LiveJournal entries with WordPress categories and tag, Tag LiveJournal entries with WordPress tags only, and Do not tag LiveJournal entries.<\/em><\/li>\n<li>How should LJXP handle More tags? <em>Choices are &#8211;\u00a0Link back to WordPress, Use an lj-cut, and Copy the entire entry to LiveJournal<\/em>.<\/li>\n<li>Select Categories to Crosspost &#8211; <em>You have the option to choose which categories of posts you wish to send over to LiveJournal.\u00a0 This allows you to target which posts and topics you wish to share, a big boon for some online publishers who are capable of writing on topic. <\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I think LiveJournal crosspost should be a benchmark plugin for all other crossposting plugins to come.\u00a0\u00a0 You can crosspost to Livejournal from other services, such as Utterz or Ping.fm &#8211; and I&#8217;ll be covering the Live Journal crossposting functions from those sites when I get to those articles.<\/p>\n<p>The next article in the series will cover the difference between crossposting endpoints and crossposting distribution points.<\/p>\n<p>Previous Entries in The Crossposting God Series:<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Article-Link (Permalink)\" href=\"..\/2008\/05\/21\/2008\/05\/21\/the-crossposting-god-series-part-1-the-introduction\/\" rel=\"bookmark\">The Crossposting God Series Part 1 &#8211; The Introduction<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Crossposting God Series Part 2 &#8211; Vox<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LiveJournal is another online blog that focuses on community.\u00a0\u00a0 While it is not as active and communal as Vox, it is infinitely more focused on true interaction between users compared to Myspace, Facebook, or any &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":97597,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2822"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2822"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2822\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/97597"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2822"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2822"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2822"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
