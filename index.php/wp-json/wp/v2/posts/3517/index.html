I guess this is later. If <a href=\"http:\/\/ohmyyod.vox.com\" class=\"broken_link\">Yod<\/a> can write about his family and his problems, I guess it&#8217;s my turn. I am going to attempt to do a post a day about my mother. Now I could take the road that I was just going to blast every negative thing she&#8217;s done to me and my siblings, however I&#8217;m not going to do that. I&#8217;m going to mention the good and the bad. The things that made me stick by her through the problems and the what made me break.<\/p>\n<p>In the end though this isn&#8217;t going to be about her. This is going to be about my inability to deal with her. I just can&#8217;t take it any more. I don&#8217;t have to put myself through any more torture just in the excuse that&#8217;s she is family. I can&#8217;t deal with her, god bless my siblings and the rest of my family that can. I&#8217;ve joked with my father (her ex) that he has talked to her more in the last two years then I have, that i still find amusing since they do not get along in any way shape or form.<\/p>\n<p>This is my cartharsis, the way of writing it down and putting it behind me. I don&#8217;t need to deal with the torture and pain anymore. I don&#8217;t need to be in the middle of the he said she said stuff. I don&#8217;t have to not tell this person this thing, but I can tell that person that thing. Thirty two years of this, I&#8217;ve finally said enough. Enough to dealing with someone who finds herself more important then anyone else.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see if any of you actually find this interesting. Whether I&#8217;m writing to the oblivion that is the Internet, whether anyone listens. Whether this matters.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I previously wrote about an e-mail my mother wrote me, I also mentioned I would follow up on this later.
