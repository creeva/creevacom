Some people think that they receive and process mass amounts of information, and some like Scoble definitely outpace by any measure of the word. Other people just seem to flip out if they have more than five emails that are not spam. We are going to just look at the last 30 days.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since I do most of my web floundering in Google Reader &#8211; let&#8217;s look at the trends:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">From your <strong> 76 subscriptions<\/strong>, over the last 30 days <strong>you read 14,054 items<\/strong>, <strong>starred 177 items<\/strong>, <strong>shared 41 items<\/strong>, and <strong>emailed 39 items<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">That is 14,054 articles that I skimmed in the last 30 days, The starred items are things that I want to get back and read later. So if we take the averages:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each day I read (or at least skim) 469 articles<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each day I star 6 articles (which is a misnomer since an hour later I unstar them, so it only counts currently starred items I think)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each day I share 1-2 articles<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each day I email 1-2 articles<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">That is literally just what I get from RSS &#8211; let&#8217;s be fair and say I go to 50-100 websites a day reading an untold number of articles. I have no true way of tracking that since I do not capture that data at all.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">E-Mail -2479 &#8211; so I&#8217;m receiving an average of 83 e-mails a day that is not marked as spam &#8211; otherwise the totals would be much much higher.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the end, is this entertaining or useful to you? Probably not, but it should give you a bit more insight into me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I consume a ton of information a day.
