Other people just seem to flip out if they have more then five emails that arenot spam. We are going to just look at the last 30 days.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since I do most of web floundering in Google Reader &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/reader\/view\/?tab=my#trends-page\" class=\"broken_link\">let&#8217;s look at the trends<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">From your <strong> 76 subscriptions<\/strong>, over the last 30 days <strong>you read 14,054 items<\/strong>, <strong>starred 177 items<\/strong>, <strong>shared 41 items<\/strong>, and <strong>emailed 39 items<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">That is 14,054 articles that I skimmed in the last 30 days, The starred items are things that I want to get back and read later. So if we take the averages:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each day I read (or at least skim) 469 articles<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each day I star 6 articles (which is a misnomer since an hour later I unstar them, so it only counts currently starred items I think)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each day <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/reader\/shared\/05232816521170045309\" class=\"broken_link\">I share 1-2 articles<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Each day I email 1-2 articles<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">That is literally just what I get from RSS &#8211; let&#8217;s be fair and say I go to 50-100 websites a day reading an untold number of articles. I have no true way of tracking that since I do not capture that data at all.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">E-Mail -2479 &#8211; so I&#8217;m receiving an average of 83 e-mails a day that is not marked as spam &#8211; otherwise the totals would be much much higher.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the end is this entertaining or useful to you? Probably not, but it should give you a bit more insight on me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I consume a ton of information a day.
