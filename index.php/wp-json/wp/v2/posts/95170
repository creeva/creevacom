costumes at the appropriate time &#8211; and only the appropriate time.<\/p>\n<p>For someone who has done tons of costumes during my time at the haunted house, the appropriate time is murky for me. \u00a0 Really, the appropriate time is for Halloween gatherings, appropriate parties, or whenever I feel like it. \u00a0 Decades ago when I wore a hat everyday, for December I changed this to a Santa hat. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t exactly for the Christmas season &#8211; it was my little costume of not caring to the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p>While I wish I had pictures of every single costume or outfit I&#8217;ve had through the years I figured I would showcase some from childhood and some from the last decade.<\/p>\n<p>I attended a Christian school, so we didn&#8217;t really celebrate Halloween that I remember. \u00a0 However, there was a fall festival where we dressed up in outfits related to nature or America. \u00a0This is me in third or fourth grade as Abraham Lincoln. \u00a0Who knew back then that Abe would become a vampire hunter in books and movies thirty years later. \u00a0 Maybe I was just predicting the future and still being subversive.<\/p>\n<p>Some other costumes I remember from my youth; C3-P0, Raggedy Andy, Ricky Racoon, a Vampire, then it starts to trail off on what I can remember.<\/p>\n<p>This image was from the first year I was thinking that I was too old to trick or treat. \u00a0I went as Billy Joel and my brother went as Jason Voorhees. \u00a0 This was the time that you are being told that you are too old to trick or treat. \u00a0That Halloween is a time for children, and somehow you crossed a threshold where you aren&#8217;t anymore. \u00a0 I remember the last minute put something together that caused me to wear this outfit. \u00a0 I really think it was the last time I stressed over it though.<\/p>\n<p>The acceptance of others and what you do is not the same of dealing with the acceptance of yourself. \u00a0 For someone in middle school, this is a big thing to come to grips with. \u00a0I know many adults who struggle with this thought process today.<\/p>\n<p>I think this was a year or two after Billy Joel. \u00a0 I was definitely in High School, because i had a suit. \u00a0The gloves were from marching band. \u00a0Looking at my brother this is probably my sophomore or junior year in school.<\/p>\n<p>While I had many costumes working at the Haunted School House, this was the one I shaped by my final year. \u00a0 Vlad was a good alter ego after doing the &#8220;what am I going to do tonight&#8221; routine that many haunted house workers go through. \u00a0I know his personality and age has screwed up my vocal cords where I couldn&#8217;t do his voice for long if I wanted to. \u00a0 \u00a0I still have the outfit though 20 years later. \u00a0 That cheap hat and his sword cane are both in my office in reaching distance as I write this. \u00a0 The shirt and cape are down in my bedroom closet. \u00a0 The glasses are located in the sunroom. \u00a0It&#8217;s all parts of the equation that was a big part of my life.<\/p>\n<p>The last time I was in full Vlad costume was 2002 when a friend and I dressed up to work in a haunted house for a night in Eugene, OR. \u00a0 It was two thousand miles away from the haunted house that Vlad was born into, and it felt wrong. \u00a0I found out that while I&#8217;m good at scaring people, it wasn&#8217;t the same. \u00a0The Haunted School House was my home. \u00a0 \u00a0I could never go home again, so I was done with haunting all together. \u00a0 I have friends that still do it, and good for them. \u00a0 It just isn&#8217;t for me because my home is gone and everything is would be hollow. \u00a0Since 2002 I haven&#8217;t gone full Vlad again. \u00a0 I may have to dig it out for a Halloween party someday.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-95171\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/176431_10151137908216121_1265878903_o-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"176431_10151137908216121_1265878903_o\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/176431_10151137908216121_1265878903_o-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/176431_10151137908216121_1265878903_o-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/176431_10151137908216121_1265878903_o-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/176431_10151137908216121_1265878903_o-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/176431_10151137908216121_1265878903_o-1-1070x803.jpg 1070w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/176431_10151137908216121_1265878903_o-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now we enter into the dad years. \u00a0 My son has been Darth Vader multiple times. \u00a0This was the second year he did it. \u00a0 My wife and I had decently expensive stormtrooper helmets and the rest of the outfit was cheaper, but we follow our sith master around faithfully as he collected candy.<\/p>\n<p>This was my I don&#8217;t have anything planned. \u00a0 The equivalent to the Billy Joel from my school years. \u00a0 Throw on a Fez and call yourself Doctor Who.<\/p>\n<p>Last year my son moved to Kylo Ren. \u00a0 Once again I pulled out the stormtrooper and guided the new sith master around the neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>This was my outfit for the Halloween Party last year. \u00a0I went full Captain Morgan. \u00a0 I love this costume. Originally I was going to reuse it again this year. However, I decided to go in a different direction. \u00a0 Also this costume is not the most comfortable thing in the world. \u00a0I remember the days I wouldn&#8217;t have needed a wig to have that hair.<\/p>\n<p>Finally I have this picture from the halfway to Halloween party in the spring. \u00a0 This was actually a trial run for the outfit I was going to wear to the George Clinton concert. \u00a0 The pants did not survive the concerts since I had to split the back (they were a Goodwill purchase) to be able to get into them.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s that mean for this year? \u00a0I have something purchased and setup, of course I may change it at the last minute. \u00a0 So many ideas, so many thing I have, so much to do. \u00a0We shall see. \u00a0One thing I do know, I&#8217;m never too old dress up.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Costumes have been a major part of who I am. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not referring to the existential sense of the masks we wear to the different aspects of the world around us, I mean costumes &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95181,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95170"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95170"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95170\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95181"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95170"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95170"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95170"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
