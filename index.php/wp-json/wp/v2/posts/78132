The main reason for this was I wanted a wired connection for the device instead of a wireless one. I knew a couple of people that owned the devices and loved them. I thought I would give it a try.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go over some background.<\/p>\n<p>For some comparison until the Roku arrived we have used an <a href=\"http:\/\/store.apple.com\/us\/browse\/home\/shop_ipod\/family\/apple_tv\">Apple TV2<\/a>. This has been jailbroken and has <a href=\"http:\/\/xbmc.org\">XBMC<\/a> installed on it. The reason we purchased the Roku is that our device started getting the infamous time bug. The ATV2 could not longer update it&#8217;s time. This meant that <a href=\"http:\/\/netflix.com\">Netflix<\/a> stopped working on the device. I am reluctant to reflash the device because I don&#8217;t want to spend the 2-3 hours it takes to set up XBMC again to my liking. Xie was miffed because she used Netflix all the time so this put a large damper on her media consumption, especially the kids shows that my son watches.<\/p>\n<p>We do have a lifetime subscription to <a href=\"http:\/\/playon.tv\">PlayOn<\/a> basic so I could use that to view Netflix and <a href=\"http:\/\/hulu.com\">Hulu Basic<\/a> through XBMC. \u00a0 The problem with that route is that you can only really watch what is in your Netflix queue. \u00a0It also does not mark once you have already seen something. \u00a0 We also tried using Netflix through the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B003VUO6H4\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=creswor20-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003VUO6H4\">PS3<\/a>, but compared to the ATV2 interface it was clunky, slow, and just didn&#8217;t work well.<\/p>\n<p>So the goal was to get a device in which we could watch Netflix without reflashing the ATV2. \u00a0 I would love to say I researched different models for days, but truthfully from what we had seen in the past Roku was really the model we wanted. \u00a0 It could do Netflix, Hulu (albeit Plus only), and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/feature.html\/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=creswor20-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;docId=1000739191&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957\">Amazon (so we could use our Prime free streaming on the TV for once<\/a>). \u00a0I did think briefly about getting a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boxee.tv\/\">Boxee<\/a>, but it didn&#8217;t have the Amazon Prime streaming and was twice the cost. \u00a0 I also had played with the desktop version of Boxee and I didn&#8217;t like the user interface compared to XBMC or the ATV2. \u00a0 Boxee was also twice the price.<\/p>\n<p>So you can see that we didn&#8217;t need something to watch Netflix. \u00a0 I just wanted to be lazy and not reflash the device. \u00a0 The other methods though were not as easy to use, so I will concede to that point. \u00a0 The rule is I can do whatever I want to the home network until it makes something more difficult to do. \u00a0 The stupid ATV2 bug broke that rule on me. \u00a0It was only my fault in so far that I didn&#8217;t want to fix it. \u00a0I purchased a Roku instead.<\/p>\n<p>Onto the Roku<\/p>\n<p>The first issue with the Roku (I knew when I ordered it) is that I was out of HDMI ports on the TV. \u00a0 I bought a HDMI switch box which allow us to switch between the Roku and ATV2 with the touch of a button. \u00a0 Currently the PS3 is without a picture.<\/p>\n<p>When first setting up the device we had to register it. \u00a0 This requires a computer to go online to the website and enter a code. \u00a0 This is kind of\u00a0a hassle. \u00a0I sit down in front of the TV to start configuring the device, and it tells me to get up and use another device.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Roku,<\/p>\n<p>The first rule of TV watching is that you want to keep the eyeballs on the TV set. \u00a0 Maybe in the digital era sans commercials this is no longer relevant. \u00a0Unfortunately for the TV viewing public this is still the golden rule. \u00a0 When I configured the Apple TV2 I did not have to use any other devices than the remote the came with the unit. \u00a0 Please work on this.<\/p>\n<p>Sincerely,<\/p>\n<p>Creeva<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This of course has the ease of use of not typing in anything on the Roku and being able to use the keyboard to set everything up. \u00a0 \u00a0You would think that wouldn&#8217;t you. \u00a0 We&#8217;ll get back to that thought in a minute.<\/p>\n<p>During the initial setup on the website you enter a code from the device to link it to your account. \u00a0You select your channels and options you want from the website. \u00a0 Third parties can offer more channels through a private channel method. \u00a0 I selected the defaults &#8211; Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Flickr, Crackle, Angry Birds and some others. \u00a0I then had to wait about 15 minutes while all the channels were downloaded to the device. \u00a0 Seriously? \u00a0I understand the ability to update the software later, but the default programs advertised on the box should have already been on the device.<\/p>\n<p>I then managed to get into Netflix. It is similar to the PS3 interface, but slightly better. \u00a0 Xie was not happy. \u00a0 We will make it work until I have time to reflash the ATV2. \u00a0 We then tried Amazon Prime, which even though we added the channel we had to link the device. \u00a0 This requires us to once again get up off the couch and go over to the computer. \u00a0 The choices are pretty much the same as Netflix with a few exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>Then we tried Hulu. \u00a0Hulu required Hulu Plus which I clicked to sign up for the one week trial. \u00a0 You can&#8217;t sign up for the trial from the device. \u00a0You have to go to your computer and fill in the information. \u00a0 You then had to use the remote on the Roku to type in your username and password. Why can&#8217;t all this account info be handled on the Roku site? \u00a0We then get into Hulu and can get a few more things than basic &#8211; but of course lose access to other shows because of weird Hulu licensing (thank god for PlayOn). \u00a0 The Hulu picture though was sharper than going through the PlayOn \/ XBMC combination we normally use.<\/p>\n<p>I tried the Angry Birds and I didn&#8217;t like the motion control remote that pretends to be a Wii controller. \u00a0At first it wasn&#8217;t responsive and then it was too responsive. \u00a0 For a game like Angry where the\u00a0gimmick is to pull a sling shot it is workable, but for anything with more precise controls I would hate it.<\/p>\n<p>Since you setup everything on the website, if Roku ever goes out of business you are stuck with a hunk of plastic. \u00a0 The ATV2 could still be usable or hacked into something else if Apple ever went out of business. \u00a0 For some this may be a real concern. \u00a0 It is unlikely since Roku seems to be in the lead as the Internet streaming to your TV provider.<\/p>\n<p>Finally I can not play any local media with Roku. \u00a0I can&#8217;t listen to a local MP3. \u00a0I can not view a local picture on my computer. \u00a0 I can not play one of my DVDs I have ripped (99% of my media collection is ripped to a file server). \u00a0With the ATV2 I use XBMC to consume these things. \u00a0 You can also import them in iTunes and play from within the standard ATV2 interface. \u00a0You can also use AirPlay from your iOS devices and stream directly. \u00a0I can set up a <a href=\"http:\/\/plexapp.com\">Plex<\/a> channel on Roku, but I&#8217;m scared how that is going to look and act compared to XBMC. \u00a0I would have to set up a second database for media since I already use a MySQL server with XBMC. \u00a0Duplication to do the same task is a pain in the ass. \u00a0I love XBMC.<\/p>\n<p>The interface is slow and clunky in all the channels. \u00a0 Xie referred to this as beta software. \u00a0I explained this was the third revision &#8211; her response was that it was still beta. \u00a0 Compared to the ATV2 I will concede that it is slower, less elegant, and the user experience for getting up off the couch to configure items is horrendous. \u00a0It does offer the Hulu Plus and Amazon Streaming which is its advantage at the same price.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earlier this week we ordered a Roku device from Amazon.
