Even when I worked at a small retail store we didn&#8217;t have the technician side of the business running the day after thanksgiving (which is where I worked). So this is a new feeling for me. On the other hand, I had a friend that stayed over the holidays and needed a ride to work in the morning today.<\/p>\n<p>I figured instead of taking him back on thanksgiving day I would take the roundabout way to work, drop him off and then scoot to work myself. I arrived to work and discovered that the doors wouldn&#8217;t open (key card locks) at 6:00 AM. Ironically I know a couple of people do make it in at 6:30 AM regularly. But being the first one into the office today gave me the great pleasure of sitting in my car in the freezing cold. If you think I&#8217;m exaggerating there was snow outside my car that can attest to the contrary. The irony is that it was 70 degrees just two days ago.<\/p>\n<p>Let this be a lesson for those that are too punctual &#8211; find out what time the doors are unlocked for you to enter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Well, this is the first day after thanksgiving I have ever had to work.
