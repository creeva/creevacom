I was 12 years old and remember listening to this on cassette playing through my boombox. While I can say as an adult I appreciate quite a few of the classic Prince songs. Until I was 12 though, I liked Prince songs the same way any pre-teen likes listening to pop music. It is designed to be liked and everything I liked was done through radio play.<\/p>\n<p>I can say it&#8217;s likely been over 20 years since I&#8217;ve heard this song. Even though in middle school it was one of the albums wearing away the motors of the cassette player. It likely inspired my hip-hop and remix love. This likely was the first remixed style music I was exposed to. There were also a few that either Beach Boys or 50&#8217;s music around this time, but for a 12 year old geek &#8211; this was gold.<\/p>\n<p>If this hadn&#8217;t come out, I likely never would have gone back and given Prince a second chance. I&#8217;ll be fair and so mostly I like his mainstream popular stuff. That being said I think the man would be happy that he at least changed me with this most shallow of songs. Just remixing and playing backgrounds to a movie aimed at teens. I&#8217;m not sure he was too tied to this song, if he was I apologize for calling it shallow. Yet the deep lines are all from lines in the movie, so&#8230;&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>He was someone that has left a great impact on the music industry. Though I&#8217;m at odds with him for his hatred of technology, we can differ. I&#8217;m just a poor guy writing on a blog and he was Prince. I&#8217;m sure he was quite happy with what he got out it. Good luck and godspeed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Prince &#8211; Batdance (1989) I&#8217;m sitting here in an airport restaurant listening to this song.
