At this moment in time I&#8217;m still not sure what is going ot be asked of me or what my duties will require.

I don&#8217;t see any issues however since all the people in the VCMA seem to have a good heart. My term is from September 1, 2008 through August 31, 2010. I guess I&#8217;ve been a board member for 4 days and wasn&#8217;t even aware of it.<\/p>\n<p>Not that it&#8217;s important, and not that most of you would care.
