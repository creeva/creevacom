I think I was a pre-teen the first time my parents tried to broach the subject. I had already been aware from enough TV shows where a parent attempted to have a sex talk with their child that it was not a good thing. I avoided it like the plague, just not wanting to deal with it.<\/p>\n<p>The first time my parents were watching the show <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dallas_(TV_series)\">Dallas<\/a> and we were all aware of how much sex is shown non-explicitly on prime-time soap operas. My parents were discussing and wondering if I understood what was happening and if it would affect me. Now I&#8217;m not going to say I understood completely, but I knew enough to understand where this conversation was headed and I didn&#8217;t want any of it. I replied that they were just going to bed and getting ready to fall asleep. That was the first time I avoided this conversation.<\/p>\n<p>It was a tight end-run in sixth grade when I scored the highest in class on a sex education test. Actually, it was more of a genetics test, but I got both the extra credit question correct, plus 100% on the test &#8211; this brought my score to 106%, the highest out of the whole 100 students in the sixth grade.<\/p>\n<p>Over the following years, I mastered avoidance of the subject, until the week before I was going to leave for college. My mother sat me down and started to explain sex to me, at this point in time why bother? I realized for some reason my avoidance tactics were not going to work this time. I told my mother point blank, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to talk about this, I lost my virginity three years ago and I don&#8217;t think there is anything you can tell me.&#8221; That shut her up, she mulled around and I went back to my day of packing.<\/p>\n<p>Now I have to start planning down the road how I&#8217;m going to talk to my kid about sex and when. I understand the avoidance tactics so they won&#8217;t be able to pull that one. Of course, if it was only my decision I would let them learn the same way I did, school gossip, school education, and practicing it themselves. Sadly I&#8217;ve already been told it isn&#8217;t going to work out that way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here The sex talk, it&#8217;s something teenagers dread and so do parents.
