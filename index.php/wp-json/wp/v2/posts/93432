\u00a0Not quite.<\/p>\n<p>Friday night Xie asked me if I spilled some water Friday morning since she cleaned some up. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t, but I thought maybe I knocked something over in my tired morning state. \u00a0 We chalked it up to the mystery that would never be solved. \u00a0It was solved, the next morning.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sitting downstairs on Saturday morning watching cartoons with Lex. \u00a0 Xie is upstairs taking a shower. \u00a0 I hear dishes shift in the kitchen, that happens sometimes. \u00a0I let it go. \u00a0 A few minutes later I hear dripping. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t a little drip &#8211; it was a big drip. \u00a0Then there were more drips.<\/p>\n<p>I rush out to the kitchen and there is water on the floor. \u00a0 There is water in the sinks that is rising. \u00a0There is water pouring out from under the cabinet. \u00a0 I sprint up stairs and tell Autumn to turn off the shower. \u00a0 I figured out pretty quickly that it was probably Lex&#8217;s flushable wipe that was causing the issue. \u00a0It was the only thing that has changed &#8211; always look at the new variables first.<\/p>\n<p>Searching online you can find out that flushable wipes are one of\u00a0the\u00a0main reasons for drain clogs these days. \u00a0 They are not as flushable as one would believe. \u00a0 They don&#8217;t break down either. \u00a0If one get&#8217;s caught it will cause a backup. \u00a0 This is what we figured happened to us. \u00a0I then did what every\u00a0red-blooded\u00a0testosterone misdirected man in America tries to do, I attempted to fix it myself.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily it was stuck somewhere in the middle of the basement. \u00a0 This meant we still had one working toilet. \u00a0We also had a working shower and washing machine. \u00a0 The sink downstairs had been\u00a0scavenged\u00a0for parts when I put a new sink in the upstairs bathroom, so that was out. \u00a0 In theory we could still bath and use the restroom.<\/p>\n<p>We got Lex out of the house and went shopping early. \u00a0I bought the usual round of industrial drain cleaner&#8217;s from Lowes. \u00a0I also bought a drain snake. \u00a0 Lex is then scheduled to go to Grandma&#8217;s for the night. \u00a0 When we get home I drop all the chemicals down the drain. \u00a0 We waited a few hours. \u00a0 We attempted to run the shower. \u00a0 There was no change. \u00a0It started to back up again. \u00a0 Xie cleaned up the kitchen. \u00a0I proceeded to pull out my snake&#8230;er&#8230;my drain snake.<\/p>\n<p>The first round was to try to go through the kitchen drain and into the main pipe. \u00a0 After removing all the under-sink pipes I quickly learned this strategy was not going to work. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t going to get it done Saturday night. \u00a0 I needed PVC pipe. \u00a0I had to cut into the spot the kitchen drain met up with the main drain. \u00a0The next day I went to home depot and bought PVC pipe. \u00a0 I also bought more industrial drain cleaner (<em>misdirected\u00a0testosterone\u00a0driven male<\/em>). \u00a0 We came home and I proceeded to cut out a six-inch section of pipe.<\/p>\n<p>With the pipe removed I managed to get into the main line (finally). \u00a0 I fed in about twenty feet of the snake. \u00a0 I hit a snag I couldn&#8217;t get past. \u00a0I attempted for about fifteen to twenty minutes. \u00a0 I had Xie run the shower to see if somehow I managed to get it clear. \u00a0 I am listening to the pipe and water is going down. \u00a0 It sounds like it is getting more shallow, but I&#8217;m not sure. \u00a0All of sudden water it just about to the top. \u00a0I yell for the shower to be turned off, but I didn&#8217;t figure the distance of the water still in the pipes. \u00a0I got splashed good.<\/p>\n<p>I knew at that moment I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to do this myself. \u00a0 I also knew adding more chemicals into the mix wasn&#8217;t going to help either. \u00a0 I had to claim defeat at the DIY scenario. \u00a0I had to call of work on Monday and call a plumber. \u00a0I would say I felt less masculine, but I&#8217;m a geek, that feeling is natural.<\/p>\n<p>I woke up at 9AM and immediately called some plumbers. \u00a0It seems that plumbers don&#8217;t answer the phone anymore. \u00a0They have you leave a voicemail message and then call you back. \u00a0It&#8217;s a\u00a0gauntlet. \u00a0 I left two messages and by eleven I hadn&#8217;t received a call back. \u00a0I then called down the list and left messages at six other places. \u00a0I called a national provider and they could be here later today. \u00a0 There was unfortunately a $69.00 just showing up before any work is done charge. \u00a0No one else had called back, so I scheduled it.<\/p>\n<p>Fifteen minutes later I did receive a call. \u00a0 They had an hourly rate of $110.00. I knew this was going to be the better solution. \u00a0 I called the other place back to make sure I could cancel. \u00a0I then arranged for my only call back to come out. \u00a0 They were there in two hours.<\/p>\n<p>They attempted to run their snake through the opening I had made. \u00a0 After two run throughs they didn&#8217;t pull anything up. \u00a0 We ran a hose down the line and it was still clogged. \u00a0They tried one more time and the same result. \u00a0 They then opened an access point at the bottom of the pipe (that I wasn&#8217;t aware was there). \u00a0 They snaked it two more times with the same result.<\/p>\n<p>Then then use the balloon spray injection method. \u00a0I&#8217;ve had to do this for clogs in the upstairs sink. \u00a0They ran this for ten minutes. \u00a0They then ran the snake through again. \u00a0No change. \u00a0After three more attempts they finally pulled up some wipes. \u00a0 A couple more attempts after that they pulled out some more. \u00a0 The drain was going faster, but still to slow.<\/p>\n<p>They then used the balloon device again and ran it for fifteen minutes. \u00a0 After that they snaked it one last time and it seemed to be flowing normally. \u00a0 They packed up and explained to me that since it was the wipes they couldn&#8217;t warranty the work. \u00a0 Everything did seem to be working though. \u00a0 My total bill was 140.00. \u00a0 The first hour was $110.00, but the second hour it took was an additional $60.00. \u00a0 They did give me a discount on a half hour because they originally quoted me $110.00. \u00a0I would have paid them $170.00 without blinking.<\/p>\n<p>The only real annoyance is they don&#8217;t take credit cards. \u00a0 We had to find the checkbook and actually write a check. \u00a0This will make three checks I write this year. \u00a0 We did talk about some options so they could take credit cards in the future, since it is annoying.<\/p>\n<p>We went picked up Lex and went out to eat. \u00a0 When we got home I dumped the rest of the industrial drain cleaner and some drano into the opening I cut on Sunday. \u00a0I then put a new section of PVC pipe in to replace what I cut out. \u00a0 I headed upstairs\u00a0reassembled the pipes underneath the kitchen sink. \u00a0 At the moment everything is working and flowing. \u00a0 It will be a bit before we take a long shower again.<\/p>\n<p>I can say if you use flushable wipes even just for toddlers, be warned that the damage can costs thousands. \u00a0 We were lucky with getting by for as cheap as we did. \u00a0 There are many horror stories out there where there is thousands of dollars in damage. \u00a0 I&#8217;m glad that with the cost of tools, chemicals, and professional I managed to get out with just about $200.00 down the hole. \u00a0Literally all the money I spent was to go down that hole.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you had a better weekend than us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; This last weekend was no fun. \u00a0 Let&#8217;s start with Friday night. \u00a0 Xie was still sick with what has lasting for the last week. \u00a0 Lex still had a cough that he had &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93433,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93432"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93432"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93432\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93433"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93432"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93432"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93432"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
