Then Spider Carrie and Spider Jason heard the steps. \u00a0The tall hooman wasn&#8217;t home, this made no sense. \u00a0The female was back and carrying a fly swatter. \u00a0 A fly swatter? \u00a0Of all the humiliating things, we eat flies. \u00a0This hooman was going to dispatch us in the\u00a0same way she dispatches our food. \u00a0 Spider Carrie managed to squeeze into a crack between the wood and watched what happened next.<\/p>\n<p>The female hooman swung at Spider Jason and missed. \u00a0 He tried to scramble underneath one of the loud spinning machines. \u00a0 He moved and she swung again. \u00a0 He ran as if his life depended on it, but the female swung a third time. \u00a0 Spider Jason was hit. \u00a0 The female hooman managed to get half of his legs. \u00a0 With his remaining strength he pulled himself underneath one of the giant spinning machines. \u00a0 He could not move well, but he was still alive. \u00a0 Spider Carrie, watching the whole thing happen, came and got me.<\/p>\n<p>Spider Carrie was crying when she came to me. \u00a0 She thought the worst had happened. Spider Carrie was also a peaceful child that thought only the best things in life. \u00a0 She had seen the terrible things that hoomans could do, but preferred to think the best of all creatures. \u00a0 They were hoomans \u00a0They acted upon instinct. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t like they could be held responsible for their actions. \u00a0They were just mindless creatures that responded to the world around them. \u00a0 \u00a0As Spider Carrie relayed the story to me I quickly gathered up some others to go find Spider Jason.<\/p>\n<p>I dispatched Spider John to guard the stairs. \u00a0 If the female hooman came back he could drop from the ceiling and scare her away. \u00a0 He was also told that if she had the fly swatter again that he should stay hidden. \u00a0 When we got to Spider Jason he was still alive, it looked like he would survive. \u00a0 Spider Jason likely would have a limp throughout the rest of his life. His ankles will never be completely right again. \u00a0 However, he would live. \u00a0 At this point we decided that we would have to make the hooman female pay for what she had done. \u00a0 We had to take control of the dwelling. \u00a0 If we scared the hooman female enough we could drive her away. \u00a0 If she went away then she would take the tall one and the short one away. \u00a0A plan started to work it&#8217;s way through my head. \u00a0 I looked through all of my eyes to study everything around. \u00a0The short hooman would be the key to us winning this war. \u00a0The annual Spider Circus was cancelled, preparations had to be made.<\/p>\n<p>Every night when the tall, female, and short hoomans were asleep we would sneak into the place the short one slept. \u00a0We think the short one is called exxxxx, but we aren&#8217;t sure. \u00a0 For this recording of spider history &#8211; we will continue to refer to him as the short one. \u00a0 Spider Rick lived the closest to this spot so it was his duty to make sure the evenings chores were done. \u00a0 Every single night without fail Spider Rick would slip into the space where the\u00a0short\u00a0one slumbered. \u00a0Spider Rick would crawl up next to the short one&#8217;s ear, close enough to yell &#8211; but far enough away that he could escape if the short one rolled over. \u00a0 Every night Spider Rick would spend time yelling &#8220;Spiders are friends&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t kill the spiders&#8221;. \u00a0 We were hoping that Spider Rick did this often enough that the short one would believe it. \u00a0 The short one would also think that he came up with this idea on his own.<\/p>\n<p>For the months we worked on this plan, we lost many brothers and sisters. \u00a0 Spider Sally was killed in the room where the water ran. \u00a0 Spider Bill was covered and paint and was frozen to the wall. \u00a0 Spider Mike had a table moved onto him. \u00a0Many many others were dispatched by the tall one and the female. \u00a0The short one however, he never killed one on purpose. \u00a0 There was Spider Al who got trapped under the carpet in the short one&#8217;s room &#8211; but that was accidental. \u00a0 It was also accidental when Spider Rick&#8217;s cousin Spider Sam didn&#8217;t keep the distance one night when visiting Spider Rick. \u00a0 While Spider Rick was yelling in the short one&#8217;s ear, the short one rolled over onto Spider Sam. \u00a0 We never blamed the short one. \u00a0 It seemed our plan was working.<\/p>\n<p>One day we saw that the plan was moving forward. \u00a0 \u00a0The short one stopped the tall one from killing me. \u00a0 He said &#8220;don&#8217;t kill the spiders&#8221;. \u00a0Our months of work was happening exactly as we planned. \u00a0 We made a friend and an ally with the the short one. \u00a0 We have turned him to our side. \u00a0 this was our chance and we were going to take advantage of it. \u00a0 The tall one routinely left the house for days at a time. \u00a0 If we could wait until one of those times, then maybe we could drive the female hooman from the dwelling.<\/p>\n<p>We went on waiting. \u00a0 Because we were also planning a birthday party for Spider Carrie we missed an attempt last month. \u00a0 This month however we had our chance. \u00a0The tall one drove off alone in the middle of the night when the female and short one were were asleep. \u00a0 We were fairly sure that this was one of the times he was going to be gone. \u00a0We waited though. \u00a0All day and night the tall one did not return. \u00a0This was our time to put our plan into action.<\/p>\n<p>The female hooman and the short one wandered down the stairs like they do most mornings. \u00a0The female opened the place that stays cold and grabbed a jug of something out of it and put it onto the counter. \u00a0At this point I dropped down from the ceiling in front of the female. \u00a0 I swung a small distance in front of her face. \u00a0The female hooman froze for a minute and made a loud noise. \u00a0 I pulled myself up to the ceiling where she couldn&#8217;t reach me. \u00a0 I waited and watched for the next step in our plan.<\/p>\n<p>The female opened the dark caves and Spider Carrie was ready. \u00a0The female grabbed the canister she grabs most mornings and Spider Carrie was there waving her legs. \u00a0Spider Carrie did not want to hurt the female, but thought the female should be taught a lesson because of what happened to Spider Jason. \u00a0 The female almost dropped the canister and started swinging around madly at Spider Carrie and myself. \u00a0The short one started yelling. \u00a0&#8220;Save the Spiders&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t Kill the Spiders&#8221; and finally &#8220;Spiders are our friends&#8221;. \u00a0The plan worked. \u00a0 The female was jumpy and not calm at all. \u00a0The short one played his role and helped us survive.<\/p>\n<p>We thought our plan was complete when the female and the short one left the house. \u00a0 Unfortunately it was just another part of the their morning routine since the female returned home by herself. \u00a0She then made herself some liquid and sat down. \u00a0 I think she was pondering the days attack &#8211; but that might be giving hoomans too much credit for thought. \u00a0 Regardless, it was a step forward in our cause.<\/p>\n<p>Spider Rick the last few weeks has been telling famous spider stories to the short one in the middle of the night. \u00a0 I think Spider Rick considers this one a pet. \u00a0 Hopefully he can train this pet to help us out in the future. \u00a0 For now though, it is time to plan for the next attack tomorrow morning.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This story started out as a Facebook post by my wife. \u00a0 I thought I would expand upon it and turn it into a story for my son. \u00a0This is what I&#8217;m going to read &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95013,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95012"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95012"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95012\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95013"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95012"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95012"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95012"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
