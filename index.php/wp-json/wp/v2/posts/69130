\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t want to handle the slow down. \u00a0 \u00a0When I took creative writing in high school I had one short story I worked on for weeks. \u00a0 I went through 20+ revisions. \u00a0 Looking back it wasn&#8217;t any better the last time than it was the first.<\/p>\n<p>Grammar and spelling were cleaned,, the story however changed. \u00a0 The story wasn&#8217;t any better or worse, but it was different from the original intent. \u00a0 I have an issue with over-editing my work. \u00a0 Once I dig into often enough the words and meanings take on a life that the hundreds of hours I put into that story really didn&#8217;t deserve. \u00a0 It should have come out a masterpiece, but this post is probably better than that whole story.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t written regularly since my son was born. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t something that was available to me until he was sleeping through the night. \u00a0 When he was sleeping through the night I was in the habit of no longer creating content. \u00a0 I was pure on the content consumption side of the bandwagon. \u00a0 I fell more into the &#8220;status update&#8221; is the new blogging mentality. \u00a0 That is not however why I started a blog. \u00a0 \u00a0I wanted to write.<\/p>\n<p>This brings us to where we are today. \u00a0 I have a desire to write. \u00a0I also have a ton of draft posts that I started and never finished. \u00a0I have to scrap most of those now because they were dependent on a time frame. \u00a0That&#8217;s ok. \u00a0 It&#8217;s about putting in the sweat until it becomes habit again. \u00a0 I slowed down so much I was at a stand still. \u00a0 I need to slowly build up the momentum and fulfill the goal.<\/p>\n<p>This post is meant to be complementary to another post I am going to write in a minute. \u00a0It&#8217;s about some conversations I had Saturday night and it wouldn&#8217;t work without pointing out the core problem and how it effected my productivity in one area of my life.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not fair and completely honest pointing out short-comings when you can&#8217;t at least point out why you may fail at the same tasks. \u00a0 You may actually be excellent at the tasks you are pointing out that some us is failing out. \u00a0However, if you&#8217;re not, you better be ready to get the mirror turned back towards you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I used to write all the time. \u00a0I did daily blog posts and no matter what I pushed something out. \u00a0 \u00a0This was as much to get in the habit when I wanted to write &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/69130"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=69130"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/69130\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=69130"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=69130"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=69130"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
