Early in the day, I had to continue multiple times on the first level. Thank God this game has unlimited continues. This game is a top-down vertical scroller game. While I can get some enjoyment from these games, generally I loathe them over time and can&#8217;t play them for more than a few rounds.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing this was an arcade port I used an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NES_Advantage\">NES Advantage<\/a> to play through it. I didn&#8217;t use slow motion, auto-fire, or any cheat codes. While I will use the continues and count those I will beat every NES game fairly.<\/p>\n<p>Because you have to think to continue (if you hit start at Game Over it starts from the beginning and hence deletes your progress) I had to go through this multiple times, one time it was the dogs that caused this as they hit start for me in between rounds.<\/p>\n<p>I managed to complete the game with five continues for all 32 levels (3 were in the last 10). The highest score was the first round with a score of 451500 according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twingalaxies.com\/\">Twin Galaxies<\/a> this would qualify me for the third place spot for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twingalaxies.com\/index.aspx?c=22&amp;pi=23&amp;gi=3645&amp;vi=2886\">high score<\/a> of all time (recorded). After things are all said and done I may come back to this game for a world record attempt later on. We&#8217;ll see how that goes.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ratings<\/span>:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Graphics<\/span> -4\/10 &#8211; Graphics are not really the high point &#8211; but then the poor graphics don&#8217;t get in the way. The one sore point I have with the graphics is that sometimes the background made the enemies and the weapons shot at me very hard to see. If I can say anything that is the biggest flaw I can see with this game.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sound<\/span> &#8211; 2\/10 &#8211; Sound is really lacking &#8211; turn down the volume and listen to something else you would enjoy more<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Controls<\/span> 9\/10 &#8211; like any games of this type control is important and this game aims to please<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Story<\/span> &#8211; 2\/10 &#8211; the only story is you know this is a WWII pilot going through waves of fighters &#8211; since some games have less of a story than this &#8211; it gets a 2<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ending &#8211; <\/span>1\/10 &#8211; It says congratulations &#8211; that&#8217;s it no credits or anything &#8211; and it only says congratulations for about 2 seconds before going to the game over screen.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Fun<\/span> &#8211; 7\/10 &#8211; since I don&#8217;t really like this type of game normally and enjoyed myself I&#8217;m giving it higher than I normally would have.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/bp2.blogger.com\/_7S-fpowJIA8\/RbxKZ-o1lxI\/AAAAAAAAAA0\/Nx6nd2x9DAg\/s1600-h\/1942_NES_ScreenShot1.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5024973094410098450\" style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/01\/1942_NES_ScreenShot1.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bp2.blogger.com\/_7S-fpowJIA8\/RbxLq-o1lzI\/AAAAAAAAABE\/MQ1PjokwPUQ\/s1600-h\/1942_NES_ScreenShot4.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5024974485979502386\" style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/01\/1942_NES_ScreenShot4.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bp2.blogger.com\/_7S-fpowJIA8\/RbxKi-o1lyI\/AAAAAAAAAA8\/0oytbkujKxA\/s1600-h\/1942_NES_ScreenShot2.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5024973249028921122\" style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2007\/01\/1942_NES_ScreenShot2.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;m not sure about the quality of my review <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/nes\/action\/1942\/player_review.html?id=168479\">here is the link<\/a> to a Gamespot player review.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Next Game<\/span>: 1943<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In my quest to beat every game officially released for the NES system &#8211; I started with 1942 the first game on the list.
