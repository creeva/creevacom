I went out to eat with her, our sisters, and our youngest brother the other day and she told our youngest she couldn&#8217;t get any peircings because &#8220;no preppy girls have them&#8221; and how they look like trash.<br \/>\nokay, well she was refering to me<\/p>\n<p>Second.<\/p>\n<p>I told summer she should really think about going to EHOVE (<em>the local vocational school &#8211; creeva<\/em>). Mom goes EHOVE is for people that don&#8217;t do good in school and our youngest sister doesn&#8217;t want to be apart of that (<em>the sister writing this went to EHOVE &#8211; creeva<\/em>). Okay.. diss to me again, which i said something.<\/p>\n<p>Third.. mom asks me if i went to Trip Ohio in 8th grade cus our youngest sister will be going next year. I say, no because she didn&#8217;t have the money for me to go so I couldn&#8217;t. I told our youngest sister that at the dinner table and mom denied all of that and said i was lieing. Right.. my older sister said the same thing thats why we both didn&#8217;t go.<\/p>\n<p>THEN..<\/p>\n<p>mom tells me to shut up, then our youngest brother makes a comment to our youngest sister..<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You know why mom is mad at you? Because you act like <em>[sister writing this email] <\/em>that&#8217;s why she hates you..&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So i wonder what she tells our youngest brother, she hates me?<\/p>\n<p>Nice.<\/p>\n<p>I stormed out of there and left.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Obviously I have replaced my sibling&#8217;s names with their rank and order. We don&#8217;t refer to our youngest sister as our youngest sister (who by the way is two years older then my younger brother). I just don&#8217;t want to be the reason their name shows up in a google search. I did think it was important to show that my views on my mother are not mine alone. I did receive permission from my sister to use this email, so there is no surprises.<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 2 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 3 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 4 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 5 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 6 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 7 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 8 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 9 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 10 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 11 here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 12 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 13 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 14 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 15 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 16 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 17 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 18 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A while back I received the following email from my sister (It&#8217;s been mildly edited to protect names and some grammar): So I just read your blog..
