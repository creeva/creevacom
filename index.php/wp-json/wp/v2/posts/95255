My son had been excited ever since he first heard about it. \u00a0 He did have a hard time reconciling the difference between the Legoland Discovery Center and the official Legoland Theme Park. \u00a0 However, we reaffirmed expectations every step of the way so he didn&#8217;t expect something the size of Cedar Point. \u00a0 In fairness the size seems to be about the size of a couple grocery stores combined. \u00a0 This isn&#8217;t to negate it, but if you are going to spend the time and money to go &#8211; you should know what you are getting into.<\/p>\n<p>We drove up the night before so we didn&#8217;t arrive exhausted. \u00a0 Since it was a three hour drive I&#8217;m not sure how my son would have taken six hours of driving and fun time in between. \u00a0 We stayed at the same hotel that my wife and I stayed at last summer when we saw Weezer in concert. \u00a0It&#8217;s a fairly nice suite hotel. \u00a0 My son was over the moon that there was a kitchen in the room. \u00a0 Since I wasn&#8217;t lucky enough to get a room upgrade, my son slept on a sofa bed. \u00a0 Luckily, he is still the age where he thought that was the coolest thing in the room. \u00a0I don&#8217;t think he has ever seen a sofa bed before. \u00a0 So it was all a new experience.<\/p>\n<p>On our last trip my wife and I found out my son won&#8217;t sleep if he notices anything else going on in the room. \u00a0 So we setup the laptop away from him and put on wireless headphones. \u00a0 We did have difficulty making it work, but as I wrote earlier, we did manage to get it all worked out. \u00a0After about ninety minutes he managed to go to sleep, we went to bed at our time. \u00a0In the morning the hotel offered a free breakfast. \u00a0 My son thought that was the coolest thing in the world. \u00a0 He piled a plat high with food. \u00a0My wife and I abstained, since we know how the food is at hotels when it&#8217;s free. \u00a0 \u00a0 It&#8217;s passable, but not something you would ever crave. \u00a0 We did save money though since I managed to cover the hotel room on rewards points.<\/p>\n<p>We stated to headed over to Great Lakes Crossing which literally was just across the parking lot form the hotel. \u00a0 This is listed as the largest outlet mall in Michigan, luckily the whole thing is indoors. \u00a0 This is different than most outlet malls. \u00a0 To be fair, this is one of the largest malls I&#8217;ve been to. \u00a0It makes we regret not driving the extra distance to see Mall of America when I was in Minnesota. \u00a0On top of a very large number of stores, inside there are multiple restaurants, \u00a0an aquarium, a 25 screen theater, and the Legoland Discovery Center. \u00a0Since my wife and I toured the place last summer, we had no inclination to do the whole loop again. \u00a0 Since only my son had eaten, we wandered over to the food court across from Legoland and had some Starbucks.<\/p>\n<p>At this point my son was getting impatient. \u00a0 He could see Legoland. \u00a0It was so close he could taste it. \u00a0Yet, we were sitting there having drinks. \u00a0 I think he finished his vanilla steamer in under a minute. \u00a0 While my wife and I attempted to engage him in conversation, it was clear that his 8 year old mind was just trapped in another world of block building. \u00a0 We relented and headed over to the center. \u00a0One thing I should note is that all adults that want to enter into a Legoland Discovery Center or Legoland Theme Park must be accompanied by a child. \u00a0 After visiting the Discovery Center, this is a good thing to keep down the crowds. \u00a0 However, in theme parks though, there is more to spread out. \u00a0 For Lego loving adults, this is just annoying. \u00a0They do have special adult nights though for those people that don&#8217;t want to hijack a child that isn&#8217;t their own for the day.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-95286\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/2017-03-04-12.04.03-1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"853\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/2017-03-04-12.04.03-1-768x1024.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/2017-03-04-12.04.03-1-225x300.jpeg 225w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/2017-03-04-12.04.03-1.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Entrance just past the ticket booth to the Legoland Discovery Center<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As we waited in line we just took it all in. \u00a0The ropes to mark off the lines were made of clear hollow tubes. Inside these tubes random bricks were dumped. \u00a0 It was all 2&#215;2&#8217;s and 2&#215;4&#8217;s at a glance featuring just the standard bright colored red, yellow, blue, and green bricks. \u00a0I would suggest buying tickets before you go so you can save some money. \u00a0One thing they offered for another four dollars was an activity book on a \u00a0lanyard. \u00a0 Of course almost every parent (ourselves included) purchased that for their child. \u00a0 \u00a0It would be nice if it was just something included with the price of a child&#8217;s ticket.<\/p>\n<p>They shuttled us to the waiting area that existed right after walking through the giant minifig shaped alcove. \u00a0 At this point, just like any other amusement park, you are accosted to get a group picture taken. \u00a0 This was one we opted not to do. \u00a0 They keep you in the waiting in this area because the attraction you go through is the Lego Factory tour. \u00a0Later I noticed a way to bypass this attraction if you really wanted to. \u00a0 However, if this is your first trip there is no reason to skip this. \u00a0As you enter in, an attendant handed Lego with the center name on it to keep for your collection. \u00a0 They only offered them to children, so I did not get my own.<\/p>\n<p>The factory tour room is a round room divided into four quadrants. \u00a0 Each quadrant has a row of controls facing a wall sized screen. \u00a0 Part of the time there is a movie playing on the screen, but it interspersed with a few activities that the controls use. \u00a0These include designing your minifig and stamping out additional minifigs on the screen. \u00a0It was cute, but if you have watched any of the Lego documentaries, you will have better understanding of the whole process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Part of Lego Detroit<\/em><\/p>\n<p>After you exit out of the factory tour you end up face to face with the Kingdom&#8217;s Quest ride. \u00a0 Unfortunately when we exited the ride was out of order. \u00a0 My son managed to get the stamps in his activity book for the The Factory tour. \u00a0 We then moved onto Miniland. \u00a0 This room is a minifig scale representation of Detroit. \u00a0 Not being a resident of the area, or familiarity with the city, I didn&#8217;t truly understand the landmarks. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t know how realistic it is layout to Detroit either. \u00a0That being said, it was a great setup.<\/p>\n<p>The next thing we looked at was the Duplo Area. \u00a0This was setup with a farm theme.\u00a0 While my son is a bit too old for this area, it was awesome to see Quatro bricks. \u00a0I was always annoyed that Quatro bricks were out of production when my son was young. \u00a0Quatro bricks are twice the size of Duplo bricks. \u00a0Duplo bricks themselves are twice the size of standard Lego bricks.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-95290\"

I&#8217;ll leave a note here that I personally dislike The Lego Friends series. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t dislike them on general principle. \u00a0There are some really cool sets in all the series that is targeted to young girls. \u00a0 What I dislike is they have a different style of figure than the minifig. \u00a0 If they used standard Lego figures, I would think these sets were great. \u00a0 It&#8217;s all a general peeve.<\/p>\n<p>There were building stations in The Lego Friends area and my son went through the flip chart. \u00a0 The problem was the pieces he needed were not in the bucket in the center. \u00a0 So if anyone was attempting to work through the building activities won&#8217;t be able to complete them. \u00a0 \u00a0These buckets should be stocked heavily with the pieces referenced on the books. \u00a0 My son was a little disappointed but wanted to move on to the next adventure. \u00a0Just about this time an announcement was made that Kingdom Quest was back in operation. \u00a0 We headed over there to get on the ride.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-95293\"

structured. \u00a0 I mentioned earlier that The Factory Tour exited right by the entrance to this ride. \u00a0This causes a general mess as this the Factory Tour group exits and people are trying to get into line for Kingdom&#8217;s Quest. \u00a0 It took a bit of yelling by the ride attendant to get people moving out of the way and organized. \u00a0 While we waited in line a little animated feature ran explaining the story.<\/p>\n<p>A princess has been kidnapped. \u00a0 It is your job to rescue the princess. \u00a0This involves chasing down zombies, skeletons, and goblins. \u00a0The ride is a dark ride. \u00a0 You go through different scenes of the story and are handed a blaster to take out the bad guys. \u00a0 Different bad guys are worth different points. \u00a0 Each car can carry up to five people. \u00a0 My wife and son sat in the front seat, and I handled covering our flank in the rear. \u00a0 One thing I noticed is that even though I was shooting straight on, it didn&#8217;t always register a hit. \u00a0 Since there is a laser pointer showing where you are shooting, I know I was shooting dead on. \u00a0 By the end of the ride, my wife had the hide score. \u00a0 I think I came in second, but I&#8217;m not sure. \u00a0It was time to go check out the other ride, Merlin&#8217;s Apprentice.<\/p>\n<p>To me this was the best experience of the day. \u00a0I&#8217;m a sucker for dark rides. \u00a0 I&#8217;ve mentioned this before in my Cedar Point pieces on The Pirate Ride and Earthquake. \u00a0 \u00a0I loved all the dark rides at Disneyworld, but the Cedar Point ones were in my regular rotations for years. \u00a0 I keep hoping they will bring a new one back.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Merlin&#8217;s Apprentice Pictures<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Merlin&#8217;s Apprentice is a lego themed spinning ride like you would find at the carnival. \u00a0It had consistent lines throughout the day. \u00a0My son did not want to ride it, so we never rode it. \u00a0 From the outside it looks like you control the height of your &#8220;car&#8221; by pedaling away. \u00a0 I&#8217;ve done enough of these rides at Cedar Point to say it looks enjoyable and not too fast for young ones.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Lego Playground<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The playground is where my son spent most of his time. \u00a0 My wife and I sat and watched while he climbed around for an hour, making friends, and exploring the structure. \u00a0 This seems to be one his major highlights of the day. \u00a0The playground is Lego City themed with a Police station, a Fire Station, and a construction area. \u00a0 There are large Lego bricks spread about and building seems to be occurring between all the climbing and swinging.<\/p>\n<p>Since we decided that he had spent enough time in the playground, it did take some coaxing to get him out. \u00a0It did help that he wanted a drink. \u00a0 So this meant he had to put his shoes back on and wander to the drink himself. \u00a0 By the time he did all of this it was easier to keep him moving along. \u00a0 Since we don&#8217;t know if we will ever return, we wanted to make sure he had a chance to experience everything.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-95281\"

Theater<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The next attraction we went to was the 4D theater. \u00a0 Luckily they have a sign that let&#8217;s you know how many minutes until the next showing. \u00a0 We got in line with 8 minutes until the next showing. \u00a0 The theater rotates through three features. \u00a0 They are Chima themed, Medieval themed, and Lego Movie themed. \u00a0 The one my won wanted to see was Lego Movie themed &#8211; and he lucked out. \u00a0That was where we ended up. \u00a0I don&#8217;t want to ruin the plot, but there is wind, rain, and snow. \u00a0 It was cute and enjoyable. \u00a0 It really was the second best thing I experienced that day.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-95296\"

table. \u00a0My son had done something similar at COSI in Columbus. \u00a0There is a platform that shakes and you are to build a structure on top of it. \u00a0There was either four or six stations at this table (I can&#8217;t remember). \u00a0 Kids would build their structures and start the shaking slow and then ramp it up with the dial. \u00a0My son \u00a0built a tower (not pictured) and showed off the survivability of his tower.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing this really shows off is the clutch power (gripping ability) of Lego bricks. \u00a0You then run into the issue that unless you really build haphazardly \u00a0on purpose, there isn&#8217;t really enough bricks to make it large enough to implode. \u00a0 So you just watch a building shake a bit. \u00a0Kid&#8217;s are amused, but a bigger building surface with many more pieces would encourage them to push the limits more.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Lego Build and Test Pictures<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Immediately next to the earthquake simulator is the build and test area. \u00a0 This was where kids would build cars and race them. \u00a0 There was a track that \u00a0allowed 5-6 kids to line up their cars. \u00a0Then the wall would come down and they would race down the track. \u00a0 This is something else my son had done before at COSI when they had their lego exhibit.<\/p>\n<p>My son worked and sharpened his design. \u00a0The first one had some dud wheels on it that would hardly role. \u00a0 After he was done losing at the races (his car kept doing a hard left turn into the wall. \u00a0 He went over to the large ramps. \u00a0On the largest he would watch his car crash into pieces at the bottom. \u00a0Then he would rebuild it and do it all over again.<\/p>\n<p>Like the playground, he would have stayed here an done this for the rest of the day. \u00a0We wanted to make he experienced everything, so we were on a timer. \u00a0 He had about fifteen minutes before The Master Builder class was starting.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-95299\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/2017-03-04-14.56.07-1-768x1024.jpeg\"

is central to all the lands. \u00a0Look at it as the rest area to get your kids focused to go onto to the next one. \u00a0Almost all of the foods offered looked healthy. \u00a0My wife had a snack of rolled Tostitos and guacamole. \u00a0 You also have the option of purchasing a plastic Lego bento box for your food shaped like a 2&#215;2 lego. \u00a0 At first I thought this was a packed meal, nope &#8211; just an extra box for your food.<\/p>\n<p>Around the edges of the cafeteria are stools, so you can easily watch your kids in different attractions. \u00a0This allows you to give them some freedom and step away from the crowds for a little while. \u00a0 This is where my wife and I watched our son on the playground, there was probably 50 people crowded around the playground watching their kids. \u00a0 This escape allowed a reprieve from the madness.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Another Shot of Lego Detroit<\/em><\/p>\n<p>On the way out my son did one of the penny presses that embossed a Lego image onto a penny. \u00a0 This is something he likes to collect when we go to different places. \u00a0 He chose the medieval figure as his choice. \u00a0 To exit you have to go through Miniland again. \u00a0 If the factory tour has recently let out, this once again will lead to a bit of congestion in the room as people are heading in different directions.<\/p>\n<p>Finally as you exit you enter into a the Lego Store (which you can visit just by going to the Outlet Mall). \u00a0 There were a few sets I wanted, but it wasn&#8217;t in the budget. \u00a0The ones I&#8217;ll make note of is the 1960&#8217;s Batman Bat Cave Set, The Disneyland Castle Set, and the Ghostbusters Headquarters. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t going to let my son leave empty handed, so we managed to get him a smaller Lego City set. \u00a0 Later he was happy he had so many souvenirs. \u00a0He managed to walk away with the activity book, the penny, brochures about the center, and a Lego set. \u00a0Best of all we all survived the madness of hte crowds. \u00a0I think that might be the best take away.<\/p>\n<p>The original plan after going to the Lego Discovery Center was to eat at the Rainforest Cafe. \u00a0 After seeing the outside and the souvenir section, my son was really excited. \u00a0That was until we get the host. \u00a0 Since we didn&#8217;t make a reservation (because we didn&#8217;t know how long we would be playing with Lego), it was a four hour wait. \u00a0 If we had been part of their paid membership group we could have gotten priority seating. \u00a0 We weren&#8217;t going to wait four hours to eat. \u00a0We could have been home in a shorter time frame than that. \u00a0 We opted to move on. Making reservations and sticking to the schedule is something you should make note of if you want to eat here.<\/p>\n<p>We asked my son what he wanted and at first he stated he wanted to go the Steak and Shake. As we were heading back to the car to go, we noticed a Johnny Rockets in the mall. \u00a0 My son opted to go there instead. \u00a0While it was crowded, we lucked out and managed to score a booth. \u00a0 He drank is milkshake, had a his burger, and life was good. \u00a0 We left and headed on the drive home. \u00a0 He passed out happy about halfway home clutching his trophies from the day. \u00a0 All in all it was a great experience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Part of Legoland Detroit This last weekend we took our son to the Legoland Discovery Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan. \u00a0This center opened last year and we finally managed to make it up to go. &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95295,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95255"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95255"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95255\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95295"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95255"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95255"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95255"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
