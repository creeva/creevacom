Do you know how hard it is to find a picture of the Tiki Twirl? I hunted and hunted for a picture of this ride hoping that it would jog a memory. I finally <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fraternalorderofmoai.org\/huimalu\/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=3774\">found an image in this forum here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Even though it was in the park the years I went, I don&#8217;t remember this ride at all. Supposedly it was located where the Matterhorn would later be. At the very least it will make it easier for someone to find a picture that validates that this ride existed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Scrambler was a ride I may have enjoyed when I was really little. These days I can&#8217;t take it anymore. I can&#8217;t really take any spinning rides. It doesn&#8217;t help that this ride spins in two directions at once.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I take after my father in the spinning rides department. My mother would take me on all the spinning rides. My father would handle the roller coaster duties. He couldn&#8217;t do spinning rides either. My mother, not a big heights fan couldn&#8217;t handle coasters. I received the best of all worlds since I always had someone to take me on a ride.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The biggest issue i had with the Scrambler in my later years wasn&#8217;t really the ride itself. It&#8217;s that it looks like a standard ride you would see at a fair or carnival. For some reason in the back of my mind I always thought Cedar Point was better than this ride. I also grew up in the Cedar Point era of mass expansion and bigger is always better. Some people however love this ride.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The nineties would have been the last time I rode it. Whenever someone else wanted to ride it, we always would. I believe I have taken my sisters on this ride with me. Never did I suggest riding it. I also do not believe I ever rode it with another male. Plenty of females, but never a male that I can recall.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I did find a video of the Scrambler ride experience (good luck Tiki Twirl hunters).<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center><\/p>\n<pre><\/pre>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Watching the video I can say that it seems to run a bit slower than I remember. I don&#8217;t know if that is because it&#8217;s been so long since I paid attention to it, or if it has just slowed down with age (like all of us). I can almost get that pit in the stomach feeling from watching the video. For all the rides going forward I am going to do my best to include a video of the ride. I should at least always be able to track down a picture. I did find the god damned Tiki Twirl.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the next part I will cover the Sky Ride and Star Voyager.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>That my friends is a picture of the Tiki Twirl.
