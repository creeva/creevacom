This is where I could get into spoilers without thinking about it. I will say that in the beginning of the film you discover that Batman has been out of action for eight years. The events of The Dark Knight created a world where they no longer thought Batman was needed. It also was an environment where Batman became a villain. Obviously since you are going to the theater you know that Bruce Wayne is going to have to put on the cowl one more time.<\/p>\n<p>The script is original, but I feel it\u00a0is influenced by three major batman storylines. \u00a0 The first storyline is Knightfall:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Batman:_Knightfall\">from Wikipedia<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>You couldn&#8217;t get into any major storyline about Bane without it be compared to Knightfall. \u00a0 To huge Batman geeks, every punch between the two in cinema it is compared to this book. \u00a0In Knightfall Bane breaks Batman&#8217;s back. \u00a0 This causes Batman to become paralyzed and unable to continue. \u00a0 As part of this line \u00a0Bruce examines the need for a Batman. \u00a0 He chooses a successor who does not work out. \u00a0 He then recovers through magical means and regains his cowl.<\/p>\n<p>While we could nitpick how closely certain segments of this book match the movie. It doesn&#8217;t. \u00a0 Yes there are similar plot points, but this is not a movie rendition of Knightfall.<\/p>\n<p>The next storyline it seems to pull from is No Man&#8217;s Land:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/No_Man's_Land_(comics)\">from Wikipedia<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0In No Man&#8217;s Land, Gotham City is half destroyed by an earthquake and cut off from the rest of the United States. \u00a0 Batman and his allies must restore peace to the city as it has become overrun by criminals and mob mentality. \u00a0 Stuck in the middle are the innocent citizens that are just trying to survive. \u00a0There are no Earthquakes in The Dark Knight Rises, but for a while Gotham does get isolated. \u00a0This isolation echoed No Man&#8217;s Land to me.<\/p>\n<p>The last book I feel had some contribution was Frank Miller&#8217;s classical work, The Dark Knight Returns:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dark_Knight_Returns\">from Wikipedia<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you squint your eyes while standing on your head, then you proceeded to hit yourself with a hammer &#8211; you would then notice that The Dark Knight Rises is exactly like The Dark Knight Returns. \u00a0 In other words, it has nothing to do with one another. \u00a0 It does have some shots within the movie that feel like they were taken out of The Dark Knight Returns. \u00a0 \u00a0They just lifted a frame from the book and storyboarded it into the movie.<\/p>\n<p>To finish on the plot, if you like any of the three story-lines I mentioned or are a Batman fan &#8211; you will love this movie. \u00a0Don&#8217;t go in expecting any of these stories to play out on the big screen, just look at them as influences to what you do see.<\/p>\n<h2>Size<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-93371\" title=\"1000px-Darkknightrisesbannerlarge1\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/1000px-Darkknightrisesbannerlarge1-1-300x138.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"138\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/1000px-Darkknightrisesbannerlarge1-1-300x138.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/1000px-Darkknightrisesbannerlarge1-1-768x353.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/1000px-Darkknightrisesbannerlarge1-1.jpeg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image <a href=\"http:\/\/dcmovies.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Dark_Knight_Rises\">from DC Movies<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The movie has a huge cast. \u00a0 You run across people you recognize from other properties and they are only in one or two scenes. \u00a0There are huge scenes of just masses of people. \u00a0Most scenes are large and feel spacious. \u00a0 Off the top of my head, I can&#8217;t think of any scenes where the characters looked cramped. \u00a0Everything in this movie screams large.<\/p>\n<p>The script is so large it takes you down rabbit holes that don&#8217;t mean anything to the main plot. \u00a0 It allows you explore minor characters in a way that would not otherwise have done in most movies. \u00a0 While rabbit holes in most movies just annoy me, the ones in The Dark Knight Rises were enjoyable and I was happy to take the journey.<\/p>\n<h2>Cast<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Dark_Knight_Rises\">from Wikipedia<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>This movie has a massive cast, but only a few major players. \u00a0 There are scenes of secondary characters that are important to the overall movie, unfortunately I don&#8217;t have the time to go over each of their roles. \u00a0 I will say that no acting in this movie seemed weak. \u00a0 It was all important.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Christian Bale<\/strong>: As a fan of Bale, I&#8217;m a bit biased. \u00a0 There are few movies that I dislike with him. \u00a0 I fell in love with his screen presence in American Pyscho. \u00a0I have followed his career ever since.<\/p>\n<p>He is the Batman from the previous two movies, so if you liked those you know what to expect. \u00a0 Some people have issue with it. \u00a0 I think it falls into realistic. \u00a0With this movie he has finally replaced Michael Keaton as my Batman of choice (<em>I&#8217;m very very sorry Micheal, I will wash your car if you ever need it<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tom Hardy<\/strong>: \u00a0Hardy was\u00a0phenomenal\u00a0as Bane. \u00a0For the first half of the movie it wasn&#8217;t believable to me and what I know about Bane. \u00a0By the end of the film as everything was pieced together of how he got to where he is &#8211; it was fantastic. \u00a0 It makes sense within the scope of the movie and the feel that this movie series has always had.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anne Hathaway<\/strong>: \u00a0For Catwoman I&#8217;m old school. \u00a0 I bounce between Eartha Kitt and Julie Newmar when I visualize Catwoman. \u00a0 My wife has always loved Michelle Pfeiffer&#8217;s\u00a0representation of the character. \u00a0 Anne however has played the\u00a0truest to comic version of the character ever.<\/p>\n<p>I originally disliked the idea of Hathaway playing Catwoman. \u00a0 How was the princess from The Princess Diaries going to do the character justice. \u00a0 I was wrong. \u00a0I think she deserves as much credit for her role as Heath Ledger received for his as The Joker.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Joseph Gordon-Levitt<\/strong>: \u00a0Joseph plays a character not from the comic books, but ingrains himself in the Batman mythos. \u00a0 As he get&#8217;s older I respect his acting more. \u00a0 I expect great things from him in the long run of his career.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Michael Caine<\/strong>: Caine is a great Alfred as always. \u00a0 The character just feels right. \u00a0 If anything the Alfred character is the closest to the real comics with no deviation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gary Oldman<\/strong>: \u00a0Oldman is another favorite of mine. \u00a0 The first movie that grabbed my eye showcasing his ability was Immortal Beloved. \u00a0 Whether he is composing music, sucking blood, or looking for his stones &#8211; Oldman always brings a distinct personality on every character he does.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Morgan Freeman<\/strong>: \u00a0Freeman was Freeman. \u00a0He is god. \u00a0 Moving on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marion Cotillard<\/strong>: \u00a0Marion played Bruce Wayne&#8217;s love interest in this movie. \u00a0 We know Batman always needs a love interest. \u00a0In this movie we have two of them. \u00a0She was great as an actress, but I can say I wanted more from the character. \u00a0 It was almost as if Bruce jumped into bed too easily. \u00a0 I&#8217;m thinking we may see their relationship play out more if there is an extended cut released later.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gotham City<\/strong>: \u00a0Gotham felt\u00a0fantastic. \u00a0The city felt real and breathing. \u00a0 That the citizens were just part of the blood stream of this enormous beast. \u00a0From the aerial shots Gotham is based on New York City. \u00a0I&#8217;ve always been in the school that it was more Chicago. \u00a0 Regardless from the wide shots to the open streets, Gotham felt like a real place.<\/p>\n<p>While these actors are\u00a0the main stars, they did manage with cameos to squeeze in at least six villains into a single film. \u00a0 Batman does not fight\u00a0each villain. \u00a0 Some of them are only there for set direction. \u00a0It was still fantastic that fit them in without feeling gimmicky.<\/p>\n<h2>Tone<\/h2>\n<p>From the music to the film color tones the film was the dark. \u00a0 This in sharp contrast to the bright tones of the Avengers and most of the Marvel movies. \u00a0 This works especially by making the Marvel movies seem like living cartoons. \u00a0This in turn makes The Dark Knight Rises seem\u00a0realistic\u00a0and plausible.<\/p>\n<p>Ever since Tim Burton directed the 1989, most of the franchise has gone dark (we will ignore Batman and Robin&#8217;s neon). \u00a0 Nolan has managed to make this series the darkest made. \u00a0 I am curious on how someone can top this in the future. \u00a0 I guess only time will tell.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>My first review was on twitter immediately after the movie ended:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Storyline, size, and overall all cinema &#8211; batman made the avengers look like the teletubbies<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I stand by that assessment. \u00a0 The Avengers was geek porn. \u00a0 It was bright and fun, but had a simplistic plot. \u00a0 \u00a0It had obvious CGI eye-candy for the sole purpose of making you eat more popcorn. \u00a0 You loved it. \u00a0 In the end though it was unsatisfying. \u00a0The Marvel movie characters are shallow. \u00a0 You don&#8217;t dig into them. \u00a0 \u00a0Iron Man is a recovering alcoholic in the comics. \u00a0The only shot of this being a problem in any of the films is the birthday party scene. \u00a0 In the end that scene falls flat.<\/p>\n<p>None of the Marvel movies dig deep into the characters. \u00a0 To be fair they don&#8217;t need to. \u00a0 Movie-goers will whip out their money for the chance of seeing geek porn and action porn on-screen in an environment that you aren&#8217;t showing an eight year old anything really dirty. \u00a0It lacks emotion and a disconnection. \u00a0With the Marvel movies you are watching humanized gods. \u00a0 They might be gods with some imperfections, but gods all the same.<\/p>\n<p>Batman is not a god. \u00a0 In Nolan&#8217;s Batman franchise he is a guy with motivation to get things done. \u00a0He conquers his ghosts and fears and moves on. Yes he has tons of money to throw at problems, but he uses a fair amount of brute force to getting things done. \u00a0 Batman seems plausible. \u00a0 Bruce Wayne feels real and tortured. \u00a0 I wish they could have given that depth to Tony Stark in Ironman.<\/p>\n<p>Overall cinematically, Nolan not only made a blockbuster, he made a film that should work over time. \u00a0 Most blockbusters have an overuse of CGI. \u00a0 I know there is CGI in the film, but none of it stands out. \u00a0 It all looks like pre-CGI special effects (<em>the motorcycle being an exception<\/em>). \u00a0It all felt\u00a0realistic. \u00a0If he didn&#8217;t use miniatures for this film, all other directors take note. \u00a0 This is way to use CGI perfectly within your film<\/p>\n<p>You have emotions for the character that echo the triumph you get from Rocky. \u00a0 You feel for Bruce from his ghosts haunting him all the way up through his triumphs. \u00a0It is the little things that pull you in and as he states in the movie &#8211; It could be anyone in the suit. \u00a0 The Batman symbol matters to Gotham, but the movie shows you the man beneath the mask of a god.<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing this movie taught me was that canon doesn&#8217;t matter. \u00a0 This whole film series took a sharp right from canon. \u00a0 It used to annoy me. \u00a0 What I realized is Batman isn&#8217;t a historical character as much as legend. \u00a0 With historical characters accuracy matters. \u00a0 With legends, the story may change &#8211; but in the heart it is still the same.<\/p>\n<p>In the end this is a film in every sense of the way. \u00a0It has depth and it has art. \u00a0 It makes you feel. \u00a0 You won&#8217;t regret watching it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from Wikipedia I would like to preface that while I feel for those that underwent the tragedy in Colorado last Friday, this is about the movie itself. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not going to allow myself &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93371,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93363"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93363"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93363\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93371"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93363"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93363"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93363"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
