section was just a javascript that rewrote the &#8220;HTTP GET&#8221; to a file named a combination of the requested page plus the password.\u00a0\u00a0 So if the page was index.tml and the password was &#8220;password&#8221; the ending HTTP in the &#8220;HTTP GET&#8221; command would be indexpassword.html.\u00a0\u00a0 Since it was still a plain text file without any encryption on it, in theory it could still be spidered and stored by google, thereby completely undermining any security it was giving them.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m working on a better and more secure solution while maintaining the balance of ease of use.\u00a0\u00a0 I don&#8217;t want to burden them too much on the security side.\u00a0 I&#8217;m sure some of the older members would blink at me with a blank stare if I handed them secureID tokens to access their newsletters.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/dwwebber\/2423302929\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2008\/08\/2423302929_e3d2c4e1e0_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Picture from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/dwwebber\/2423302929\/\">here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The next thing I discovered is that code each web page by hand, ugh.\u00a0 There was no way I was going to maintain each HTML manually and hope for any semblance of style and continuity between pages (an issue they had in the past).\u00a0\u00a0 They had been using FrontPage and offered to buy me a copy.\u00a0 First no, no and no &#8211;
