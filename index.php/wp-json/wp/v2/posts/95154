that should have been found quickly. \u00a0 Rebuilding or rerouting \u00a0around around a proxy server might take tons of reconfigurations of routers and other servers along the way, so it may have all hinged on that server.<\/p>\n<p>Being a nice guy who had done all the research and troubleshooting &#8211; and seeing I could access Facebook, I sent a message onto the ISP of the issue and the symptoms. \u00a0 Of course it was a Facebook moderator who knows nothing about any of what you just read, they gave me the standard &#8220;thank you, we are aware there are outages in your area and we don&#8217;t have an ETA for service to resume&#8221;. \u00a0That person calls it outage when his page doesn&#8217;t load and doesn&#8217;t look any further than rebooting the modem.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing I found out helped me get connected to the wider world any sooner. \u00a0 But I understood the problem even though if I called tech support, they would have had no clue what I was talking about. \u00a0That&#8217;s fine, it&#8217;s not monkey and not my circus. \u00a0 Granted I may throw peanuts at the monkey to amuse me and help me get things done, I&#8217;m still at the mercy of the organ grinder to turn the crank. \u00a0 At least it is all working now.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
