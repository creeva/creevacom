I left this comment on the page:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>You know you stated that this was blogged without permission to my site on the page http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/08\/08\/i-cant-link-to-your-web-site-man-your-retarded\/<\/p>\n<p>The problem with this is that you released your photo under creative commons. For all my posts I only seach for flickr photos licensed via creative commons, just so I can use images legally.<\/p>\n<p>I clearly underneath the photo linked back to this page which is attribution &#8211; I didn&#8217;t obfuscate, nor did I claim it was my original image. If anything it was to help drive traffic back to your site since I didn&#8217;t want attribution given to me any way shape or form.<\/p>\n<p>Now I don&#8217;t mind the fact that you state it&#8217;s blogged without permission, but this comes down to the fact that you licensed your photo under creative commons originally, and you don&#8217;t seem to understand the rights you&#8217;ve given up by this. I&#8217;m not using this commercially, so I am within my right.<\/p>\n<p>Please see this flickr search:<\/p>\n<p>http:\/\/flickr.com\/search\/?q=Kitty+Reindeer&#038;l=cc&#038;ss=0&#038;ct=0&#038;w=all<\/p>\n<p>and you can verify that this image is listed under creative commons use &#8211; or see this screenshot http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/creeva\/2909390861\/<\/p>\n<p>Under more in depth searches &#8211; you are not allowing commercial use of this photograph, which I am not doing. You are also not allowing anyone to modify, adapt, or build upon &#8211; which I also am not doing.<\/p>\n<p>Also though Flickr allows you to remove a creative commons license legally once something is released under creative commons it&#8217;s eternally released and irrevocable.<\/p>\n<p>While my first instinct was to remove this image I&#8217;m letting it stand because of the license you chose regardless of your understanding of the license.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If the creator had contacted me in any way shape or form this may have been a different issue and I may changed the image (at least on this site I don&#8217;t know if I could catch everywhere I crosspost to). Now however since I am a firm and hard believed in public domain and creative commons rights for creators, it&#8217;s become a matter of principle. If someone doesn&#8217;t understand what creative commons is, they shouldn&#8217;t use it otherwise they will loose rights that they thought they had. I did not publish this in a book and made no commerical profits off htis image. I followed the license as it was written and intended. If the creator didn&#8217;t understand those rights, well that&#8217;s another issue.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here.
