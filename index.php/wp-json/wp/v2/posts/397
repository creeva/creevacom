There is no way they could charge you under the indecency side of this coin if you could wear the same outfit sans pants. Unfortunately, I have a feeling that most people are not going to fight this.<\/p>\n<p>I would not go out of my way to change my apparel just to protest this action, but let&#8217;s say I could give points for the finer points around this law that the lawmakers would have a lot of justifying and explaining to do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The news article is here.
