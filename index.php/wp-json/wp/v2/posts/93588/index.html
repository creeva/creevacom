In the wide world of publishing, this isn&#8217;t go to affect me very much. In the last decade I have maybe purchased two or three issues of the magazine. I guess I am part of the problem. I am now and will always be a Nintendo fan boy. Nintendo is a big part of it.<\/p>\n<p>The picture above is the cover of the first issue of Nintendo Power. I had that issue. Looking at the dates, I believe I purchased the first issue before <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2009\/01\/08\/my-first-job\/\" class=\"broken_link\">I had saved up enough on my paper route to purchase my NES<\/a>. If this is true I&#8217;m sure it just fueled my desire for the system so much more.<\/p>\n<p>I used to read Nintendo religiously. For around three I had a subscription to the magazine. The first year I managed to snag a subscription, my grandparents purchased it for me as a Christmas present. The best part about it was that was the time they were giving away a free Dragon Warrior cartridge with a subscription. It was my first dip into RPGs on a console.<\/p>\n<p>For the most part the games I owned growing up were second stringer games. X-Men, Back to the Future, Three Stooges, and other discount titles were what I received as gifts. I was lucky enough to some top-notch titles, but I ended up trading games quite often with friends to get a well-rounded experience. I loved the NES.<\/p>\n<p>Since I am still in doubt where I heard about the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2012\/04\/26\/the-nintendo-world-championships\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Nintendo World Championships<\/a>, it was likely within the pages of Nintendo Power. Like the magazine, seeing a convention center piled with Nintendo games was a dream come true to my young geek heart. I could never get enough Nintendo. When my thoughts waned on the system, a new issue of Nintendo Power arrived and I was all set to go again.<\/p>\n<p>I started dropping off in the SNES era. I picked up the magazine more infrequently . I didn&#8217;t have a subscription anymore so I missed out on some great strategy guides. I lost touch and moved away from gaming a bit. Then emulation brought me back in.<\/p>\n<p>Emulation is great. Being able to play any game you want, when you want is fantastic. This made me want to buy the real hardware again. Since that time I have slowly built up my retro collection. It started with the NES. Then I got another NES. It followed down the road until I had two NES&#8217;s, two SNES&#8217;s, N64, Gamecube, Gameboy, Gameboy SP, Gameboy DS. I won&#8217;t say Nintendo systems are all that I own, but they are the ones closest to my heart. Especially the NES and SNES.<\/p>\n<p>I will have to content myself with Nintendo Power issue scans from the years that I truly enjoyed it. Somewhere along the way it lost the feel that I loved. It is possible I just outgrew the magazine. For a moment I thought, what if I just subscribed still? Would the magazine have kept going? Then I realize I&#8217;m pretty much a print is dead type of person. I wouldn&#8217;t have read or enjoyed them the same. It would just be a hollow grasp to hang on to something I&#8217;m past.<\/p>\n<p>I still love the original cartridge games. I will always love Nintendo Power and all the joy it gave me on rainy afternoons. It will be missed. I may have grown past the magazine, but you never forget those first loves. May the magazine forever be held with fond memories and let&#8217;s hope it is leaving at the proper time. It didn&#8217;t leave to early, and I hope it didn&#8217;t stay to long. Once again, thank you Nintendo Power for being a part of my life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from Wikipedia Yesterday it was announced that Nintendo Power will soon be publishing their final issue.
