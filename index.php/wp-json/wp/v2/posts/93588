\u00a0Would the magazine have kept going? \u00a0Then I realize I&#8217;m pretty much a print is dead type of person. \u00a0 I wouldn&#8217;t have read or enjoyed them the same. \u00a0 It would just be a hollow grasp to hang on to something I&#8217;m past.<\/p>\n<p>I still love the original cartridge games. \u00a0 I will always love Nintendo Power and all the joy it gave me on rainy afternoons. \u00a0 It will be missed. \u00a0 I may have grown past the magazine, but you never forget those first loves. \u00a0 May the magazine forever be held with fond memories and let&#8217;s hope it is leaving at the proper time. \u00a0 It didn&#8217;t leave to early, and I hope it didn&#8217;t stay to long. \u00a0 Once again, thank you Nintendo Power for being a part of my life.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from Wikipedia Yesterday it was announced that Nintendo Power will soon be publishing their final issue. \u00a0 In the wide world of publishing, this isn&#8217;t go to affect me very much. \u00a0 In the &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93589,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93588"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93588"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93588\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93589"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93588"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93588"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93588"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
