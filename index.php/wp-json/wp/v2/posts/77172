Image from Wikipedia<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Going from oldest to newest attraction would be starting with the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hotel_Breakers\">Hotel Breakers<\/a> that opened in 1905. \u00a0 Technically the hotel is outside of the park, but it became very important to season pass holders that new the ropes. \u00a0 I guess that would mean it was really useful to poor teenagers who lived at the park. \u00a0There were \u00a0a few reasons one would visit the hotel. \u00a0 Logically the first would be the pass through from the Ocean Motion entrance of the park to the Magnum XL. \u00a0 Depending on the traffic going through the park on a given day this could get you past the crowds and from one side of the park to the other quickly. \u00a0The added bonus is that we could check out the girls in the hotel pool, at the beach, or even soak city. \u00a0So the scenery was nice to a 13-16 year old boy.<\/p>\n<p>When it was raining outside and you did not have any money to make it worthwhile to hang out in the arcade, the hotel was a great place to relax. \u00a0 We would just hang out in the lobby sitting in comfortable furniture in a fully climate controlled environment while people inside the park were huddling together under the smallest of canopies trying to stay dry. \u00a0 The public bathrooms were always nicer in the hotel than in the park. \u00a0You actually had a feeling of privacy for the most part. \u00a0 Privacy was something that normally was in short supply at the park.<\/p>\n<p>The best part back in my early season pass days was the food you could get from the hotel. \u00a0 Whenever my group of friends went to Cedar Point, most of our\u00a0money ended up in the arcade. \u00a0This meant little money for food. \u00a0 We discovered that in the hotel (circa 1989-1990) there was a sandwich machine. \u00a0 Next to the sandwich machine was one of those coffee machines that dropped down the cup and then filled it. \u00a0 For under two dollars you could get a hot chocolate and a very dry sandwich. \u00a0 These combined were cheaper than any other single item in the park (which out the time your best bet was a slice of cheese pizza for around 2.50-3.00). \u00a0 This just gave us more money to spend at the arcades until we figured out the great arcade scam of 1989 (next story I promise).<\/p>\n<p>There was also a restaurant inside the hotel where we would gawk at the people eating. \u00a0 I have never eaten there, so I can&#8217;t say anything about the cost or quality. \u00a0 I have eaten at the TGI Friday&#8217;s attached to the hotel. \u00a0It\u00a0opened sometime after I was in high school. \u00a0The prices were a dollar or so more expensive per plate than a regular Friday&#8217;s, but cheaper than inside the park. \u00a0 It was a damned if you do, damned if you don&#8217;t for a full meal in an air-conditioned space.<\/p>\n<p>Finally the last thing I can mention about the Hotel Breakers is the arcade. \u00a0The arcade was smaller than any other one in the park (there was at least 3-4 other ones on the property). \u00a0 It was normally uncrowded, it had a unique game or two that couldn&#8217;t be found anywhere else in the park, and there was no Cedar Point attendants watching over your shoulder. \u00a0 It was privacy, granted if you like skeeball, that was not available at this arcade.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Hotel Breakers Today \u00a0&#8211; Image from Wikipedia<\/em><\/p>\n<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t think I have as many memories about any other hotel on the planet. \u00a0 There are a few hotels I have spent more time in than the Hotel Breakers, but then again I never stayed the night there. \u00a0 I have watched the Fourth of July fireworks from its deck chairs, took advantage of its cheap sustenance, and went girl watching there &#8211; but I never stayed the night. \u00a0 Maybe someday I&#8217;ll take Lex and stay the night, just so we can both find out what it is like to ride a roller coaster less than 10 minutes after waking up.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cedar Point was a large part of my childhood. \u00a0 It almost seems as a constant in my life, an old stability that you grew up and will always remember fondly. \u00a0 I&#8217;m guessing people &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":77174,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/77172"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=77172"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/77172\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/77174"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=77172"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=77172"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=77172"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
