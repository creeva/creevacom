The other account has very little in the way of comments since I&#8217;ve been more of a reader than a commenter. Thinking that Slashdot really managed to get inroads as an open-source news site it&#8217;s odd that they are essentially stuck in the same mindset as they were about 10 years ago.<\/p>\n<p>I made a discovery today as I made a comment and wanted to start interacting with the community more. It seems you can&#8217;t get something as simple as an RSS feed of your comments out of the site. Can&#8217;t get your posted comments e-mailed to you on submission (you can get replies to your message mailed &#8211; go figure). Can&#8217;t track your friend&#8217;s comments via an RSS feed or mail notification.<\/p>\n<p>Now I can track friends, news, shouts, comments, and more on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.digg.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digg<\/a>. Slashdot, however, only allows me a feed of the latest news. I may be wrong and maybe it&#8217;s a whole lot easier than I&#8217;m letting on, but there seems to be no easy way to do it. I did manage to copy the comment I made today to coComment &#8211; viva comment saving &#8211; but I would have preferred to pull it out myself and control my data. If coComment natively supported Slashdot I probably wouldn&#8217;t mind or even have noticed. But it doesn&#8217;t (I don&#8217;t blame coComment).<\/p>\n<p>Slashdot needs to get with the times and allow me to move my data from their servers. If I write a thought I should be able to pull it out via at the very least an RSS feed. While I can see why they don&#8217;t allow you to delete comments, it&#8217;s just one more constraint that they put on your data (I don&#8217;t think users should be able to delete comments in a forum such as this, but thought it should be noted.)<\/p>\n<p>Slashdot, please join the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dataportability.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data Portability Group<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;ve been a Slashdot member for years (I would show you my uber l33t low(er) number but I can&#8217;t find the password).
