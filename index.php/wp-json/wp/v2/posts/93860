There have been other game show scandals over the years. \u00a0The movie <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quiz_Show_(film)\">Quiz Show<\/a> showcased the scandals from the fifties in the game <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twenty_One_(game_show)\">Twenty-One<\/a>. \u00a0These scandals were designed\u00a0to maximize ad revenue by having users wanting to see how far someone could go. \u00a0 America had this a few years ago on Jeopardy when <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ken_Jennings\">Ken Jennings<\/a> just dominated. \u00a0The difference between Ken Jennings and the predecessors in the fifties is that Ken did not have the answers beforehand. \u00a0Contestants in the fifties that were charismatic\u00a0were given answers before the show started and caused a ban on trivia shows for years.<\/p>\n<p>Press Your Luck however was mostly about spinning and going around the board. \u00a0 The trivia section was about earning spins to go around the board to compete for cash and prizes. \u00a0 The game at the time had a tragic flaw that any computer security can point to as a big issue &#8211; a poorly seeded random number generator. \u00a0 More specifically the patterns used to move around the board were limited to six different patterns. \u00a0 A gentleman named <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michael_Larson\">Michael Larson<\/a> from my home state of Ohio figured out that there were only six patterns by watching many episodes. \u00a0 Not only did he figure it out, he memorized the order.<\/p>\n<p>In June of 1984 Michael went on to win $100,237.00 dollars exploiting the pattern memorization. \u00a0At first they didn&#8217;t want to pay him the money. \u00a0 The asserted he cheated, but before the show went live they knew about the weakness in their patterns. \u00a0 They thought it was good enough &#8211; which is the security that catches up with most companies. \u00a0The outliers are always there to exploit the system. \u00a0Michael was definitely an outlier.<\/p>\n<p>There is some suspicion that other people before Michael were able to figure out the flaw. \u00a0 The difference is those people never made it on the show. \u00a0Michael was lucky just like Arthur Chu. \u00a0 It&#8217;s one thing to have a method to exploit a system. \u00a0It is something completely different to be able to put it into practice. \u00a0The people capable of exploiting a system know they will likely only have a single shot to put an exploit into practice. \u00a0Once the exploit is discovered it normally is patched. \u00a0 In Press Your Luck they added more random patterns to the board and the system was never broken again.<\/p>\n<p>CBS was embarrassed by the whole incident. \u00a0 After the initial airing of the two episodes Michael was on it was barred from being broadcast again. \u00a0 Even when the Gameshow Network purchased the rights to air old episodes &#8211; there was a clause that stated they couldn&#8217;t air those two episodes. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t until 2003 (19 years later), that the episode was seen again as part of the documentary posted above.<\/p>\n<p>The legacy lives on. \u00a0With anything that includes any semblance of pattern, people think they can break the system. \u00a0 There are huge databases of lottery numbers to track likely candidates for the next drawing. \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately it is just as likely to hit the same number everyday for a month than it is to land on any specific number. \u00a0 I had a friend once that was sitting at a slot machine once swearing after he had spent $20.00 that he figured out the system and he was going to win the rest of the night. \u00a0 He did not. \u00a0The hopes of thinking you&#8217;re the smartest person in the room is what games of chance are designed to do. \u00a0 With the exceptions like Michael Larson&#8217;s run &#8211; normally you aren&#8217;t the smartest person in the room. \u00a0It is however, advantageous to the person making money of you to convince you that you are.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Earlier this morning in my news feed there showed up an article about hacking Jeopardy. \u00a0I highly suggest reading the article. \u00a0 It&#8217;s about Arthur Chu and his unorthodox method for controlling the Jeopardy board. &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94330,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93860"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93860"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93860\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94330"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93860"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93860"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93860"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
