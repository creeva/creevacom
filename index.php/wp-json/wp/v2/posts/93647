\u00a0 Blogs would have to adapt and develop new commenting systems. \u00a0Companies such as <a href=\"http:\/\/disqus.com\">Disqus<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/intensedebate.com\">Intense Debate<\/a> rose in prominence just because they offered integrated commenting solutions that were better than native ones. \u00a0 Looking around the blogosphere today it seems like a desolate wasteland when it comes to comments.<\/p>\n<p>The comments and discussion have moved away from the actual content provider to third-party platforms that are no longer embedded. \u00a0 For the conversations occurring on Twitter, reactions can still be track. \u00a0 They are still one step removed. \u00a0 Most of the discussion occurs on Facebook and hopefully other third-party social networks in the future. \u00a0 Because of privacy, these reactions will never be known.<\/p>\n<p>Before anyone thinks that this is a complaint about the lack of comments on my site, it&#8217;s not. \u00a0 My site is a small personal niche site that isn&#8217;t designed to get many comments. \u00a0 It is a place I can write whatever I like. \u00a0 Sometimes the stories do inspire a conversations, but it doesn&#8217;t occur here. \u00a0 It does occur on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>We could argue that comments are just a way to measure interaction with your audience. \u00a0 That isn&#8217;t the true market the blogs are going for. \u00a0It&#8217;s all about the page views. \u00a0 The page view business has become so intense that sites like Mashable have moved away from being the most informative site for cloud culture online to a click-fest of pseudo-Greek pulp culture. \u00a0This allows Mashable to make you click-through more pages. \u00a0 It gives Mashable more page views. \u00a0 It allows them to serve more advertisements and demand a higher cost because of the amount of page views they have.<\/p>\n<p>Even though commenting isn&#8217;t the real business of most sites, they have lost something. \u00a0 We saw it with the change in <a href=\"http:\/\/digg.com\">Digg<\/a>. \u00a0 The only reason I read Slashdot anymore is the conversations, and those are a shadow of what they were. \u00a0 It&#8217;s all moved to Facebook. \u00a0 The idea that your direct peer group is an echo of who you are is laughable. \u00a0 I&#8217;m the perfect example of that.<\/p>\n<p>Very few people on my friends list are alpha geeks. \u00a0 We are separated by issues we bite our tongues on out of politeness. \u00a0 We differ greatly on views from things such as pop culture all the way to religion and politics. \u00a0 Only a small percentage of our friends can even have a discussion on some of our most passionate interests. \u00a0 If we all liked the same things, what fun would that be? \u00a0If your whole peer group is just like you &#8211; you need to really get out more.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on blogs allowed us to find others with a similar interest. \u00a0 It might be just that one story or one moment in time, but we could have a discussion. \u00a0 That doesn&#8217;t really occur anymore, except on Facebook. \u00a0 I thought about this while reading through Read Write Web. \u00a0They are one of the tops tech blogs in the business. \u00a0 According to one analysis, they receive over a million page views per day. \u00a0 Going down the front page I saw maybe four comments in total. \u00a0 Each story has had tens of thousands of view, but no one stopped to leave an opinion.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure there are some lively discussions within Facebook on some of the stories. \u00a0How would Read Write Web ever know? \u00a0 They don&#8217;t see this feedback, and maybe sites such as Mashable have diminished over time because of this lack of feedback. \u00a0This problem isn&#8217;t unique, most sites I visit don&#8217;t have commentors unless there is a political or religious bent to it. \u00a0 Lack of discussion leads to stagnation.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the point of this article? \u00a0I&#8217;m not sure there is one. \u00a0 I think I&#8217;m just mourning for the loss of what used to be one of the best web experiences. \u00a0 We have moved away from\u00a0openness\u00a0and into walled gardens. \u00a0 Somehow we all consider this better because we have friends performing curation for us, and we might take the time to comment or like those stories within our closed infrastructures. \u00a0 What happens when the writers don&#8217;t get the feedback? \u00a0 They just write for page views. \u00a0 This doesn&#8217;t necessarily give us a better culture. \u00a0 When you write for the lowest common denominator all the blogs will write the equivalent of US Weekly.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Remember about four or five years ago when commenting was all the rage?
