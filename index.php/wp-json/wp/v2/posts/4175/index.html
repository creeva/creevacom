It seems whatever issue I have with them, they don&#8217;t read what exactly I want. Key word analysis is great guys, I did it when I worked phone support at <a href=\"http:\/\/symantec.com\">Symantec<\/a>. What I didn&#8217;t do is misinterpret everything the customer said on every single issue. If something isn&#8217;t working you have to fix it.<\/p>\n<p>Warning for the non-geeks that read my site, this is about to get technical.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go back to the beginning and flash forward to present day. In September I really wanted to add <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Transport_Layer_Security\">SSL<\/a> for the administration section of <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\">my blog<\/a> &#8211; simple, easy, and secure. The biggest reason for this was the <a href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.org\">WordPress<\/a> 2.7 series offered better support for SSL, so now why the time to start instead of hacking around with plugins for support. This turned out to be not so simple.<\/p>\n<p>Online I found my hosting provider is supposed to offer a server self signed certificate, so I sent the following message to tech support:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Is there a shared server certificate for SSL that I can use for my WordPress installation?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m fast and willing to pick through things on my own, so before technical support could reply I added this second message to my brand new ticket.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I found the SSL manager in cpanel &#8211;<\/p>\n<p>1. Do you have instructions on properly generating your SSL key for use with<br \/>\nthis (wording might be wrong &#8211; but how to configure this so I can use it with<br \/>\nmy localhost\/wordpress domain?<\/p>\n<p>2. Do you instructions on using this with WordPress?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Simple and straight forward I thought. Here is what I got back:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Hello,<\/p>\n<p>If you install the shared SSL for the domain, you will be getting warning when<br \/>\nyou take the site.<\/p>\n<p>It is better to buy SSL from third-party Godaddy.<\/p>\n<p>Please check the link given below for installing SSL.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpanel.net\/support\/docs\/11\/cpanel\/sec_ssl.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/www.cpanel.net\/support\/docs\/11\/cpanel\/sec_ssl.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In case you have any more queries, please don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us with<br \/>\nall the required details. We&#8217;ll be happy to assist you further.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Let&#8217;s throw the bit of broken english aside for a moment and break this down. I am aware (of course they don&#8217;t know this) that I will be getting a certificate mismatch error when I login to the SSL site. Problem one I see is that they are sending me a third party, yet they sell an SSL service &#8211; I find this odd, but <a href=\"http:\/\/godaddy.com\">Godaddy<\/a> (I&#8217;m assuming that was what he meant) is cheaper. Good customer service? Maybe. The other problem is that he sent me the instructions to doing this in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpanel.net\/\">Cpanel<\/a> 11, all fine and good, but they have all of their customer on Cpanel 10. The instructions were similar and I followed them. After implementing the changes I attempted to go to my website on HTTPS. <a href=\"http:\/\/mozilla.com\">Firefox <\/a>threw out the following message:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Secure Connection Failed<\/p>\n<p>An error occurred during a connection to localhost\/wordpress.<br \/>\nSSL received a record that exceeded the maximum permissible length.<br \/>\n(Error code: ssl_error_rx_record_too_long)<\/p>\n<p>The page you are trying to view can not be shown because the authenticity of<br \/>\nthe received data could not be verified.<\/p>\n<p>* Please contact the web site owners to inform them of this problem.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I spent a day researching this message, BTW Firefox&#8217;s documentation of error message is terrible, hence why it took me a day instead of minutes. Also Firefox&#8217;s documentation is wrong as I would find out later. After a few days of trying to get this to work I gave up and wrote this off as a lost cause for the moment and focused on other things.<\/p>\n<p>Flash forward to yesterday, I decided to reopen this ticket since again I wanted SSL. I knew from experience that the shared certificate would not work properly, so I went and generated <a href=\"http:\/\/www.instantssl.com\/ssl-certificate-products\/free-ssl-certificate.html\">a free (valid) one from Instant SSL<\/a>. I wanted to do this before purchasing my own SSL certificate from Godaddy, just to make sure everything was working properly. I went through all the steps and I go the same error message. Well I saved the thirteen dollars a valid certificate would have cost, but wasn&#8217;t any closer to my end goal of an encrypted WordPress administration section. I still wanted this so I opened the original ticket back up (tech support hates that BTW) and added the following note:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m back to this again &#8211; I was considering buying SSL instead of using the<br \/>\nshared cert &#8211; but having applied a cert from Comodo &#8211; I&#8217;m getting the same<br \/>\nerror in firefox:<\/p>\n<p>Secure Connection Failed<\/p>\n<p>An error occurred during a connection to localhost\/wordpress.<br \/>\nSSL received a record that exceeded the maximum permissible length.<br \/>\n(Error code: ssl_error_rx_record_too_long)<\/p>\n<p>The page you are trying to view can not be shown because the authenticity of<br \/>\nthe received data could not be verified.<\/p>\n<p>* Please contact the web site owners to inform them of this problem.<\/p>\n<p>If I try Internet Explorer it doesn&#8217;t even connect<\/p>\n<p>If I use digicerts SSL checker &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.digicert.com\/help\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/www.digicert.com\/help\/<\/a> I get this:<\/p>\n<p>DNS resolves &#8216;localhost\/wordpress&#8217; to 69.4.229.212<br \/>\nNo certificates were found.<br \/>\nOutput from &#8216;openssl s_client&#8217; command:<br \/>\n13127:error:140770FC:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown<br \/>\nprotocol:s23_clnt.c:585: CONNECTED(00000003<\/p>\n<p>Now following godaddy&#8217;s instructions it seems I need access to cpanel WHM &#8211;<br \/>\nwhich is something from a shared hosting perspective I need you to implement.<br \/>\nCan I get this done &#8211; also I&#8217;m perfectly fine using a self signed server<br \/>\ngenerated cert (which is what it currently is now)<\/p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;m not using a shopping cart and I&#8217;m only going to use SSL for<br \/>\nmaintenance of WordPress, it&#8217;s perfectly fine for me to receive the security<br \/>\nexception warning in Firefox since it will not be a customer facing error, I<br \/>\nonly want the encryption side, not the non-repudiation side of SSL.<\/p>\n<p>Also the instructions you sent me are for Cpanel 11 &#8211; currently my account uses<br \/>\ncpanel 10 when I login<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>For those technical people who understand what I&#8217;m trying to carry out, am I unclear on this? Please excuse my muddled use of non-repudiation. Also that stupid Firefox message I stated was vague, well it seems the server wasn&#8217;t even completing the connection properly &#8211; stupid Firefox error messages. This is the response I got back:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For installing a dedicated SSL certificate on your domain, you will have to<br \/>\nbuy a static IP(dedicated IP) for your domain. For that you need to<br \/>\ncontact our billing department.<br \/>\nAfter obtaining a static IP, we will assign that IP to your domain. You can<br \/>\nupload your cert , key and CA bundle for the site to the server so that we<br \/>\ncan install the cert for you.<br \/>\nAlso please note that there will be some downtime for the site until the IP<br \/>\nchange propagates globally.<\/p>\n<p>Please confirm if you need a static IP for the domain, so that we can forward<br \/>\nthis to the concerned department.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now what part my message did they not understand I did state that I was perfectly fine with an error message, that I wanted to use the shared certificate. I think I implied fairly well that I would prefer to use the shared certificate, that way I wouldn&#8217;t have to actually buy my own. This is the problem you get into when you do keyword scanning, at least the first guy with broken english understood my question better. My response:<\/p>\n<p>Like I said in my earlier e-mail &#8211; I do not need a static IP, nor do I need<br \/>\na dedicated SSL certificate &#8211; I&#8217;m fine using the standard shared SSL<br \/>\ncertificate &#8211; as was\/is advertised online that all plans came with a shared<br \/>\nserver SSL cert &#8211; that is what I would like to use and that is what is not<br \/>\nworking.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe they&#8217;ve finally understood my issue?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We are checking your query regarding shared SSL in detail. We will get back to<br \/>\nyou with the updates soon.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Soon came about thirty minutes later:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>After careful review of this ticket, we have decided that you could be better<br \/>\nassisted in another department within our company.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason, we are transferring your ticket. Please expect a short period<br \/>\nof time where this ticket is not updated, as it is queued up at its<br \/>\ndestination.<\/p>\n<p>We make every effort possible to take care of every ticket as quickly as we<br \/>\ncan. We will contact you shortly.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for understanding,<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Was was nice enough to leave off the names of their technical support staff. What I don&#8217;t understand is why I have to go to another department &#8211; maybe I&#8217;m going to the server admins who actually make the changes? Any time I have an issue it seems that I have to go through a lot of back and forth in the technical support team. If you techies read my inquiries as unclear, please let me know. As I get more information I&#8217;ll be updating the comments.<\/p>\n<p>Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr<\/p>\n<p>UPDATE &#8211; not often I get to update &#8211; it seems HTTPS is now working on my domains &#8211; well kind of. I still have more configuration to complete on my side, but it is at least answering now. Only took thirteen hours.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So I&#8217;ve talked about my hosting provider before, their tech support isn&#8217;t the brightest crayons in the box.
