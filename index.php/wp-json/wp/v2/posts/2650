but geez my life seems to be a whirlwind sometimes that doesn&#8217;t stop.<\/p>\n<p>And then we&#8217;re back to the blog. \u00a0 I&#8217;m actually bad.\u00a0 I need to look at and write on the blog more often.\u00a0 It relaxes me.\u00a0 It actually completes me in a Jerry Macguiresque way.\u00a0 Getting more serious writing on my blog gives me the true fulfillment in my life that only two other things give me currently. \u00a0 My wife, is my stability, my rock, the one that inspires me to be better than I am.\u00a0 She has a higher viewpoint of me than I do myself. \u00a0 Even though I think she is wrong, I know her belief in my skills is not false from her point of view, just false from my belief in reality. \u00a0 I love her deeply and completely. \u00a0 The last thing that finishes off my triage of life and completes me is playing music in the two community bands I am a member of.<\/p>\n<p>These are the three things that I attempt to focus on &#8211; to get out of the draft &#8211; because it calms and centers me.\u00a0 I hope the three of them are never finished.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You ever get one of those times that you step away from your blog for a few days (ok a couple of weeks for me) and it seems that you need to go through the &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":99987,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2650"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2650"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2650\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/99987"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2650"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2650"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2650"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
