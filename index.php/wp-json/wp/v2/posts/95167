Mostly this is for downloading metadata (which Plex ignores anyways) and having an offline catalog when I&#8217;m away of what media I have. I don&#8217;t watch much with it. \u00a0 However, when I was on the road I did have a video file that VLC couldn&#8217;t play (I&#8217;m was as a shocked as you are), Kodi played it without issues.<\/p>\n<p>So Kodi in the household has become an also ran in the home usage election. \u00a0 I loved it and it had about a seven year run, I couldn&#8217;t however keep using it because they never managed to get shared libraries or set top box players correctly. \u00a0 For a single system you were using everything on &#8211; hands down use Kodi. \u00a0 The learning curve between the products is about the same. \u00a0 If you are juggling multiple devices and systems in the house to play media on, Plex is the way to go. \u00a0 I will add one caveat, on the Amazon Fire Stick, the interface was like it was on the PS3, slow and buggy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; For a long time I juggled around with many media players on my home network. \u00a0 I&#8217;ll be honest if I&#8217;m playing something quick and locally VLC has been my go to choice. \u00a0It &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95168,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95167"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95167"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95167\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95168"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95167"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95167"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95167"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
