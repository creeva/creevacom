Like the commentator stated I only wish Palin to be sunk on her own merits and don&#8217;t wish to spread more false accusations. While I may not like any of the candidates I will only be spreading true stories as far as I can find them. I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t research this thoroughly enough before i posted it. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no real secret that I am very unhappy with both candidates in the race and will vote for neither. I would Digg or post more things from the Obama side that showed some of the gaffes and issues, unfortunately it seems it is easier to dig up dirt on the republicans. <a href=\"http:\/\/liveleak.com\">LiveLeak<\/a> printed a story about the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.liveleak.com\/view?i=d3e_1220752423\">books that Palin wanted (wants) to ban<\/a>. I don&#8217;t believe in the banning of any material nor do I believe in censorship. I believe this is at ethical odds with the freedom of speech. So even though I consider myself a republican, I guess in Palin&#8217;s eyes I&#8217;m not a good one. Let&#8217;s look over the ones I have read (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.liveleak.com\/view?i=d3e_1220752423\">read the article for the full list<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain<br \/>\nBlubber by Judy Blume<br \/>\nThe Canterbury Tales by Chaucer<br \/>\nCarrie by Stephen King<br \/>\nChristine by Stephen King<br \/>\nCujo by Stephen King<br \/>\nDay No Pigs Would Die by Robert Peck<br \/>\nDeath of a Salesman by Arthur Miller<br \/>\nFlowers For Algernon by Daniel Keyes<br \/>\nForever by Judy Blume<br \/>\nGrendel by John Gardner<br \/>\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone by J.K.

I apologize for being dirtied by these words &#8211; or something.
