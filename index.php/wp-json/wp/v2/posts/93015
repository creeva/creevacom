I left my guild which was originally started to be an entertainer guild. \u00a0 I eventually moved out of the town where I was the first mayor. \u00a0 April 2005 truly was the beginning of the end.<\/p>\n<p>I will say that I continued to play Star Wars Galaxies off and on over the last six and a half years. \u00a0 On December 15, 2011, the servers went dark for one last time. \u00a0 It was the spark that disappeared from one of the most advanced MMOs that was ever created. \u00a0 Everyone knew about the emulated servers. \u00a0 The last most of us looked they were not in a game-worthy state. \u00a0 It is just a small place to visit and have small duels. \u00a0It was not a world we could truly occupy. \u00a0 With the alpha release of the emu, that almost has changed.<\/p>\n<p>I use the term almost because there are still things to work out. \u00a0 There are a handful of professions that still need to be implemented properly. \u00a0 The bazaar terminals are down for another week. \u00a0 The control lag makes things a bit awkward (but I&#8217;m assuming this is because of the popularity). \u00a0 It does however feel like home for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>I think the strangest thing about last night was playing the game in OSX. \u00a0 There never was an OSX client for the official game. \u00a0The clever hackers at the emu managed to use a Wine wrapper and get the game working perfectly. \u00a0At first, I could only play in windowed mode, but I managed to fix that myself also. Once in the game, so many things came flooding back and some were still out of reach.<\/p>\n<p>Our friend Imcus is getting the band back together. \u00a0 He is working through word of mouth of collecting the Star Wars Galaxies Intrepid people. \u00a0 Together we may at least have a home again that we can inhabit or at least visit. \u00a0He warned us to skip the new player tutorial or we wouldn&#8217;t get our modest stipend.<\/p>\n<p>I recreated Creeva and chose the entertainer profession. \u00a0This means I got the ugly white outfits with the yellow stripes. \u00a0 I also received 1100 credits, a CDEF pistol, a survival knife, and a maroj melon. \u00a0Then the game told me to go. \u00a0 For those who had never played the game, I will say they would be completely lost. \u00a0Go? \u00a0Go where? \u00a0What do I do? \u00a0 The answer of course is &#8211; whatever you want. Welcome to the sandbox world of gaming.<\/p>\n<p>Do you want combat? \u00a0 You can become a fighting professional. \u00a0 Do you want to make things? \u00a0You can become a crafter. \u00a0Do you want to entertain? \u00a0 Then get in the cantina and shake your booty. \u00a0 We don&#8217;t have quest A, then B, then C. \u00a0 We don&#8217;t need them. \u00a0 We have a virtual world with a war going on. \u00a0We can do whatever we want.<\/p>\n<p>What did I do? \u00a0 Well, I knew what I needed. \u00a0 I was already an entertainer, but I also knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. \u00a0 I went to the scout trainer so I could get terrain negotiation. \u00a0 I then went to the marksman trainer so I could start my journey toward rifleman. \u00a0Then Xie and I headed from Theed to Keren, she needed to track down the brawler trainer. \u00a0Xie will be the Tera Kasi Artist again, the way she is supposed to be.<\/p>\n<p>We showed up at the shuttle port and bought our tickets to the Keren Starport. \u00a0 We dutifully took our tickets to the protocol droid. \u00a0 He told us there would be a three-minute and forty-one seconds until the shuttle would arrive. \u00a0 How rude! \u00a0Don&#8217;t they know who I am? \u00a0 When I left the galaxy shuttles would be at my beck and call. \u00a0 We waited and the shuttle arrived. \u00a0 We were on our way to the next town.<\/p>\n<p>While in Keren we decided to go do a mission. \u00a0 We had to remember that we needed to get all the missions (<em>2 per person<\/em>) in the same direction. \u00a0 We headed out towards the first mission which was 1100 meters away. \u00a0 When we made it within a hundred meters it respawned another 400 meters away. \u00a0Oh, the joy and pain for SWG missions.<\/p>\n<p>We snuck up\u00a0cautiously\u00a0over the ridge and saw the beast we had to kill. \u00a0It was the dreaded Peko Peko birds that haunt the countryside of Naboo. \u00a0They give children nightmares and share the bones with the gungans. \u00a0 They are nasty creatures. \u00a0I drew my little CDEF pistol and wished I had a rifle with me. \u00a0 \u00a0I took aim and shot at the first one.<\/p>\n<p>I hit the Peko Peko and he did not like that. \u00a0 He came right towards me. \u00a0 Xie proceeded to slap him around and call his mother a durni. \u00a0 I just kept shooting. \u00a0 I was running up and down the hill doing my best to not fall to this dangerous beast. \u00a0 Finally, he must have been exhausted from chasing me, he laid down and died. \u00a0 Then we took out its dreaded lair. \u00a0 Before the fight was finished we took at least a dozen of those dreaded menaces to be one with the force. \u00a0 We collected our 684 credits and decided to head back to Starport.<\/p>\n<p>We decided we would head for the largest hive of scum and\u00a0villainy in the galaxy, Mos Eisley. \u00a0 When we entered the Keren Starport I went straight for the ticket terminal. \u00a0 Xie went to the starship terminal wondering why it wasn&#8217;t working. \u00a0 I gently reminded her that it was part of her previous life, not her new one. \u00a0 We both ran to the starship at top speed so we didn&#8217;t miss our flight.<\/p>\n<p>We arrived in Mos Eisley safe and sound. \u00a0However, I believe our captain took us through a meteor shower on purpose. \u00a0 \u00a0Regardless, we could smell the crisp desert air even in the Starport. \u00a0 There were people out front milling about, but we pushed past them and headed to the cantina.<\/p>\n<p>When we entered the cantina it was exciting. \u00a0 There were at least fifty people inside. \u00a0 I set up in the middle of the floor and played that number one hit &#8220;Star Wars 1&#8221;. \u00a0Who can forget the shrill sounds of a slitherhorn gently putting you to sleep? \u00a0\u00a0 The blatting overtones were music to everyone&#8217;s ears. \u00a0 Xie danced elegantly and beautifully as always.<\/p>\n<p>After a while, I noticed that I was ready to learn some new things. \u00a0Unfortunately, there was no one responding to my requests to be taught. \u00a0So I kept playing until I had to go to bed. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t want to go to bed, but unfortunately, we are not as young as we used to be.<\/p>\n<p>Before saying goodbye I went to go find an NPC (Nice Person. Cool!). I was hoping I might find a nice CDEF rifle on him after I lulled him to sleep. \u00a0 I couldn&#8217;t find one anywhere. \u00a0I did find a nice narglatch with a red sign on him. \u00a0 I thought that meant he was ready to party. \u00a0 I went up to pet him and the next thing I know I awoke in a cloning center. \u00a0 I then logged.<\/p>\n<p>In the past when I switched servers they didn&#8217;t have the feel of Intrepid. \u00a0 I wasn&#8217;t there in the beginning. \u00a0 I&#8217;m now on a server that is just forming. \u00a0 It is going to find its identity and I&#8217;m going to put my little fingerprints in at least part of it. \u00a0I might even find a home there.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from SWG not the Emu.\u00a0 Last night I received a gift. \u00a0I was able to play SWG the proper way for the first time since April 2005. \u00a0 That was the date the dreaded &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93016,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93015"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93015"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93015\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93016"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93015"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93015"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93015"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
