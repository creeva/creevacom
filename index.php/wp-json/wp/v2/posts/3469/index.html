It states that I republish materials from other sites onto this blog. This is not untrue, though 90% of my posts actually originate from there. If I write something I centralize it all on localhost\/wordpress. It&#8217;s simple. It&#8217;s efficient. It allows me centralize and backup my writing.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, they aren&#8217;t wrong. One of the underlying experiments that this blog does is crossposting. It crossposts to <a href=\"http:\/\/myspace.com\">myspace<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\">facebook<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/tumblr.com\">tumblr<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogspot.com\">blogger<\/a>, and many more. I don&#8217;t make huge piles of cash (haven&#8217;t made a dime in my pocket yet). I don&#8217;t blast people with ads, though on some sites including the main there are some that are there. I&#8217;m not doing it to drive up profit in any way. I&#8217;m doing it so different communities can read my stuff. I won&#8217;t harp on it, <a href=\"http:\/\/journeytogetpaid.com\/2008\/01\/23\/brand-management-branding-yourself\/\" class=\"broken_link\">I&#8217;ve written about my crossposting before<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The question is how relevant is Technorati becoming. I know this question has been asked before, and I used to believe in Technorati. I didn&#8217;t start 500 blogspot accounts to promote the material. I used 1 public site per service. For the point of experimentation and proof of concept. I also have been slowly working on a whole article series on how to crosspost. With the myriad of services and the fact that data is not yet truly portable, but beginning to become so. How can these services accurately track where information is originating from.<\/p>\n<p>Like I said I&#8217;m not annoyed, I can live without technorati. When people are posting links to their site on tumblr, <a href=\"http:\/\/friendfeed.com\">friendfeed<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\">twitter<\/a>, and others how long before there are more people like me? Services like <a href=\"http:\/\/ping.fm\">Ping.fm<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/hellotxt.com\/\">HelloTxt<\/a> serve in a market segment only to fuel this further. I&#8217;m not someone who has a targetted truly branded blog beyond self branding. I don&#8217;t have a certain topic set I cover and regulary write about. I&#8217;m a schizophrenic writer that is all over the place. The only thing I hope is consistent is my voice. Beyond that take away from my writing what you will.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I really didn&#8217;t have time to write about this last week when it first came to my attention but it seems that localhost\/wordpress has been banned from Technorati for gaming the system.
