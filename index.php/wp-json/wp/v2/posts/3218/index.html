I understand the author&#8217;s point that if you are using these services you are not taking an interest and active use in the social community that you are using these services to post to. I can say from hits for ping.fm beta code requests on my blog, that lots of people are interested in getting access to ping.fm. Now that it&#8217;s out of private beta I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll lose my number one spot in google for the term &#8220;ping.fm beta code&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>If people want this what does this say? It really means that we have diverse friendships. We have communities that we want to share information with. We don&#8217;t have time to manually copy or paste, nor do we have the time to try to convince everyone we know to use a single service. Since we can&#8217;t bring our friends to the service (much to the dismay of the social network providers), we take our information to them.<\/p>\n<p>We want to share our information, we don&#8217;t want to hoard it. I for example do all my writing on <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\">my main blog<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/creeva\">twitter<\/a>, and a handful of other services. Yet I have friends on almost every little social network out there. Why should I be forced to choose between friends and the information I share with them? Yes, I&#8217;m sure some actual readers that are not into crossposting get annoyed over the repeated information on multiple services. What about my friends though? Where does the line between a healthy blogging business end and friendship cross? My friends are the ones that inspire me, they will always have information directed toward them. I am more than willing to take my information to them. At what cost, a minor annoyance to literally a handful?<\/p>\n<p>No one is forced to read my messages. No one is forced to follow me. No one is forced to my site. If the author doesn&#8217;t follow ping.fm links, so are them. I&#8217;m not losing what I truly care about. Maybe when a single network has all the features I want and 99.9% market dominance &#8211; then I&#8217;ll stop cross-posting. Until that time I&#8217;m proud to be a crossposter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There was an article on mashable today questioning if ping.fm and hellotxt were helping the web world or hurting it.
