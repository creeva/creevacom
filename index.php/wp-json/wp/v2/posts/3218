\u00a0It really means that we have diverse friendships. \u00a0We have communities that we want to share information with. \u00a0 We don&#8217;t have time to manually copy or paste, nor do we have the time to try to convince everyone we know to use a single service. \u00a0 Since we can&#8217;t bring our friends to the service (much to the dismay of the social network providers), we take our information to them.<\/p>\n<p>We want to share our information, we don&#8217;t want to hoard it. \u00a0I for example do all my writing on <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\">my main blog<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/creeva\">twitter<\/a>, and a handful of other services. \u00a0 Yet I have friends on almost every little social network out there. \u00a0 Why should I be forced to choose between friends and the information I share with them? \u00a0 Yes, I&#8217;m sure some actual readers that are not into crossposting get annoyed over the repeated information on multiple services. \u00a0 What about my friends though? \u00a0 Where does the line between a healthy blogging business end and friendship cross? \u00a0My friends are the ones that inspire me, they will always have information directed toward them. \u00a0 \u00a0I am more than willing to take my information to them. \u00a0 At what cost, a minor annoyance to literally a handful?<\/p>\n<p>No one is forced to read my messages. \u00a0 No one is forced to follow me. \u00a0 No one is forced to my site. \u00a0If the author doesn&#8217;t follow ping.fm links, so are them. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not losing what I truly care about. \u00a0 Maybe when a single network has all the features I want and 99.9% market dominance &#8211; then I&#8217;ll stop cross-posting. \u00a0 Until that time I&#8217;m proud to be a crossposter.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There was an article on mashable today questioning if ping.fm and hellotxt were helping the web world or hurting it. \u00a0I understand the author&#8217;s point that if you are using these services you are not &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":97597,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3218"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3218"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3218\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/97597"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3218"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3218"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3218"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
