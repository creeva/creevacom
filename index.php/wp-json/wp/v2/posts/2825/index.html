The first thing I noticed was the touchpad stopped working. Um&#8230;.ok. Then I was getting errors on boot up, more or less when I logged in some packages kept crashing and wouldn&#8217;t restart. Upon trying to fix and reinstall packages I managed to lose gnome and then I couldn&#8217;t do anything.<\/p>\n<p>I did manage to get into the laptop last night with a Hardy Heron live DVD With this migration and the thought that I&#8217;m going to have to reinstall Linux anyways (yes I could sit down for more hours and repair the ubuntu installation, but I&#8217;m originally a windows guy I&#8217;ve saved my data it&#8217;s quicker at this point to format\/reinstall), that I would try to get OSX working on my laptop. I have heard with the Intel GMA video driver there are some mouse artifact issues, but I didn&#8217;t notice any problems when I booted up the install DVD (this was when I was trying to decide my course of action and before I saved the data). Since I&#8217;ve read that the wifi works now, and the touchpad and audio should work, I don&#8217;t really have a care about the fact that the built-in webcam might not work.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using my work Mac Air most of the time at home and figured it is time to take a plunge to try to go more OSX based. I&#8217;m going to try to dual boot between OSX and Ubuntu, but I think that&#8217;s mostly to stick around for gnome conduit since that&#8217;s the only unique app worth me sticking around for. I do have it running on my n810 and I&#8217;ll still have Linux on there, so I&#8217;m it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m running. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m experimenting around.<\/p>\n<p>So after I&#8217;m done I&#8217;ll let you know how successful I am.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So most of you know that I was running Ubuntu Hardy Heron, but during some patching, I hit some data corruption that caused my laptop to go all screwy.
