whatever you don&#8217;t really want to call.\u00a0 I had this the other day.\u00a0\u00a0 So I receive this message via <a href=\"http:\/\/myspace.com\">Myspace<\/a> from a friend that another person I know wants me to call them.\u00a0 In the quick message it left a phone number and something about getting computers or doing some consulting work.\u00a0\u00a0 I thought as long as it fit within my schedule I was game.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The person I was supposed to call was someone that I&#8217;ve said less then a dozen words to over the last seven years.\u00a0\u00a0 This person also used to live with my wife and myself, and the communication stopped when I asked him to leave.\u00a0\u00a0 From his point of view I was in the wrong and should apologize, I on the other hand just wish him a good life.\u00a0\u00a0 That information is only to give you background on the situation, someday I&#8217;ll write up that whole story and he can show up and refute any claims on it he may like.\u00a0\u00a0 He was always my little brother in a way you think brothers should be, my actual little brother and I didn&#8217;t nearly get along so nicely.\u00a0\u00a0 So happy life to him, I hope he does well.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So this is why the Myspace message was so odd.\u00a0\u00a0 First it&#8217;s out of the blue, and second the guy didn&#8217;t contact me directly.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s be honest for a minute, it&#8217;s not like I am very hard to find on the intrawebs.\u00a0 Heck the girlfriend he lives with has me on her Myspace friend&#8217;s list.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m still puzzled by the intermediary maneuver.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I know I have certain skills and knowledge based out of his friends that he talks to, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m entirely unique unless it&#8217;s something specific or security related.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That&#8217;s another thing that I find strange in this whole process.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since it was a chance to make a few extra dollars I made the call.\u00a0\u00a0 I received his voicemail.\u00a0 I left a message and my call back number, giving him my <a href=\"http:\/\/grandcentral.com\">Grandcentral<\/a> number to call me back on.\u00a0\u00a0 So far it&#8217;s been two days and no return call, and he didn&#8217;t just call and hang up since Grandcentral would have logged that.\u00a0\u00a0 I guess I&#8217;m more curious on why me then anything.\u00a0\u00a0 The ball is in his court though.\u00a0\u00a0 I left a message, so he has my info.\u00a0\u00a0 I guess tomorrow I&#8217;ll give the intermediary the message that it didn&#8217;t seem that important.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Mundane story?\u00a0 Yes it is.\u00a0 It just popped into my head so I thought I would write it out.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You ever had one of those incidents where you don&#8217;t really want to call someone?\u00a0 It can be the person, the time you have available, the circumstance, or the resolution &#8211;
