However, if you don&#8217;t I highly suggest you go out now, get at least 2 more friends, and buy a deck. I think your other two friends can teach you because they already know how to play. Uno is one of those card games that every family seemed to play when I was growing up. My wife&#8217;s family was big into <em>Rummy,<\/em> well mine was <em>Uno<\/em> all the way.<\/p> <p>When my wife and I had our first townhouse together, we had a standard open-door policy for certain friends. That meant that many nights we would stay up late into the night talking, hanging out, and playing games. Uno went on for months and became highly competitive. It got so bad the first part of the game was to strategically remove me from the game from a points perspective so the goal was 1st or 2nd place.<\/p> <p>I remember one evening we had a terrible run where there was a blue nine up on the discard pile. No one could play on it for four or five rounds. It mocked us. Eventually, we manage to get past it with many more cards in our hands. A few games later in the evening after being mercilessly pummeled by Draw cards on all sides, one of the others went out. I had about thirty cards still. I was exasperated and paraphrased Shakespeare, shouting &#8220;Blue Nines, on all of your houses&#8221;. That was twenty years ago, it still gets quoted among the three of us today.<\/p> <p>To kill time during the downtime at the computer store I worked at I searched for a copy of <em>Uno<\/em> to play against the computer. &nbsp; This was the late 1990-something and there wasn&#8217;t many options to play a digital version of <em>Uno<\/em>. &nbsp;I ran across a <em>Windows 3.x<\/em> version of Uno called <em>Hot Death Uno<\/em>. &nbsp;It managed to run on Windows 98, so life was good. &nbsp; The game was crazy. &nbsp; I don&#8217;t mean crazy like last nights episode of <em>The Simpsons<\/em>. &nbsp; This is crazy like the person you used to date that use as a cautionary tale.<\/p> <p>I found <a href=\"https:\/\/phoneboy.com\/hdu\">a blog post that explains how to play it with real cards, you can go over the full rules there<\/a>. While that post explains it fairly well, I think I may have used these rules or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oocities.org\/hotdeathuno\/\">these rules<\/a>&nbsp;when I made my physical deck. &nbsp;We are going to go over the different cards involved. &nbsp; <a href=\"https:\/\/boardgamegeek.com\/boardgame\/15228\/hot-death-uno\">The images are borrowed&nbsp;from this link<\/a>.<\/p> <h2>Special Card Rules<\/h2> <p>Be warned, the cards have non-politically correct and harsh language.
