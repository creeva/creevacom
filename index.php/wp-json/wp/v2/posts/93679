15-year-old boy and he has forever left his mark on Internet history.<\/p>\n<p>The second issue would have been just a year or two earlier. \u00a0 I can&#8217;t find the exact date. \u00a0It was when I was working in a small PC shop in Amherst, OH &#8211; that much I remember from a timeline perspective. \u00a0 In my downtime I was attempting to read Slashdot.org the page wouldn&#8217;t load. \u00a0 That was odd, but I moved on. \u00a0 Sporadic sites would work and others did not. \u00a0At first I thought it was out connection, but I kept looking.<\/p>\n<p>What I started to notice was sites that I knew were hosted on the West Coast were not working. \u00a0 The sites that were located on the East Coast were working. \u00a0 I did some traceroutes and confirmed after so many hops that the West Coast sites would stop responding along the way. \u00a0They didn&#8217;t all stop at the same place, but it was a definitely timing out.<\/p>\n<p>News sites were reporting that the same problem was happening in reverse, that the West Coast couldn&#8217;t access East Coast sites. \u00a0 \u00a0Some sites would work, but the traffic was slow as it was routing through Asia and Europe to cross from one coast to another in the United States. \u00a0 News was flowing through phone calls and being published on the their respective coasts.<\/p>\n<p>What happened is that one major backbone broke between the coasts. \u00a0 The remaining backbones (which there were few at the time) couldn&#8217;t handle the extra traffic and started just getting clogged and couldn&#8217;t handle the rest of the traffic. \u00a0 This is an apt moment to have Ted Stevens to explain that the Internet is not a big truck, but a series of tubes:<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<\/center><br \/>\nSo the backbones were clogged and it took hours (I remember it taking all\u00a0day) to get the backbone back up. \u00a0 I remember my wife thinking there was an issue with our Internet that day, but went through the findings and waited it out. \u00a0 Back then most people thought an outage wasn&#8217;t a big deal, but I was a heavy internet user even back then. \u00a0 Most people watched cable, I used the Internet.<\/p>\n<p>It was just a day of time though. \u00a0 No major\u00a0repercussions have lingered over the years and this technical difficulty seems to be hard to find. \u00a0 I might even be remembering the time wrong and it might have been the Mafiaboy attack. \u00a0 Regardless, that was when I remember the Internet breaking under the load the users put upon it. \u00a0 This newest DDoS, I haven&#8217;t noticed a blip. \u00a0 Not even a minor slowdown. \u00a0 \u00a0I think I am going to fall in with Gizmodo and think this is just another tale by Chicken Little.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
