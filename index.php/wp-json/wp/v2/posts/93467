This social spark lit the kindling that gave the civil rights movement until separate but equal was abolished.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go back for a moment in the 1980&#8217;s. \u00a0 My father did not like homosexuals. \u00a0 He had issues that his five-year old liked listening to the Village People. \u00a0He complained openly about disliking Boy George, I assumed at the time it was because of woman&#8217;s clothing. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t understand.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I even understood what gay was in high school. \u00a0In high school my grouped of friends (me included) mocked a couple of guys for being gay. \u00a0 In some instances it was really bad. \u00a0In this day and age it would definitely be considered gay bashing. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t think any of us truly thought they were gay. \u00a0 It was wrong.<\/p>\n<p>About ten years ago I was at the point where I knew what it was, I just didn&#8217;t want to see it. \u00a0 Homosexuals could do whatever they wanted behind closed doors. \u00a0If I didn&#8217;t see it, then it did not affect me at all. This changed when I was living in Oregon.<\/p>\n<p>I mentioned that thought process during one of our Wednesday martini outings in downtown Eugene. \u00a0I brought it up because a lesbian couple was cuddling and kissing as they were walking by. \u00a0 Another girl who came with a co-worker stated that she was a lesbian and had a problem with that thinking. \u00a0 She asked me if I had a problem with a heterosexual couple kissing in public. \u00a0 I responded that I didn&#8217;t . \u00a0 She said she did have a problem with heterosexuals carrying on in public.<\/p>\n<p>How do you respond that? \u00a0You can try to defend that it&#8217;s always been that way. \u00a0 You could try the mightier than thou Christian angle (which while I am Christian, I don&#8217;t believe in that stance). \u00a0 You can kind of just admit defeat. \u00a0I think I had couple more comebacks to save face, but she won the discussion.<\/p>\n<p>That exchange stuck with me and eventually changed my viewpoints. \u00a0I called my father since that was my first memories on the subject. \u00a0 He is where I was ten years ago. \u00a0He never had that girl at the corner to challenge and erode his thoughts. \u00a0 That&#8217;s fine. \u00a0 I have no hatred to those that aren&#8217;t there yet. \u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t mean they are anti-gay, they just still have a bridge to cross.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in equality for every person. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t care if they are a man, a woman, \u00a0different races, different sexual preferences, or transgendered. \u00a0Everyone deserves equal rights. \u00a0 \u00a0One friend on Facebook wrote the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>This could be the HR Nerd in me &#8211; but isn&#8217;t it also the American way? &#8220;Treat every person with honor, dignity and respect \u2013regardless of their nationality, race, creed, sexual orientation or gender&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>We can&#8217;t pretend that homosexuals do not deserve to be married because of some ancient book. \u00a0 If you truly believed that, you should allow them to get married and burn in hell. \u00a0How does their marriage affect yours? \u00a0 Marriage is a legal contract. \u00a0If you view it as the way it is intended, religion has no place in it. Marriage existed in the civilizations in North America before Christianity ever spread here. \u00a0I don&#8217;t know if there were gay marriages, but it was about loving the one you are with.<\/p>\n<p>In my lifetime I knew prejudice existed and social norms can change. \u00a0I have watched from a time when it seemed that homosexuals didn&#8217;t exist to being friends with a couple in my life. \u00a0 \u00a0 It used to be they hid in the closest, but for the most part they can be openly gay in society now. \u00a0When I was a child interracial couples were frowned upon. \u00a0 Mixed couples received strange looks and condescending stares from society around them. \u00a0 It&#8217;s nothing strange today.<\/p>\n<p>If you had told me when I was in school that there would be another civil rights battle that would exist in my lifetime I wouldn&#8217;t have understood. \u00a0I would have thought everyone is free equal. \u00a0As an adult I can realize that this is another civil rights battle that needs to be fought.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like the term pro-gay marriage. \u00a0 I&#8217;m pro-equality. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t believe in separate but equal. \u00a0Five years ago I would have been pro-civil unions as a compromise in this situation. \u00a0It&#8217;s not a compromise though. \u00a0It is separate but equal. \u00a0 This is something that fifty years ago our country fought against. Something that my whole I was taught was wrong. \u00a0 The people of my generation that have had this indoctrinated into us as being wrong, you should be ashamed that you can not see the similarities. \u00a0 \u00a0There can be no separation there can only be the ratification for marriage to consist of two people that are of legal age and are capable of entering a legal binding contract.<\/p>\n<p>To those that spout that gay marriage leads to pedophile marriage or bestiality. \u00a0 Individuals under the age of eighteen cannot enter into a legal contract. \u00a0 In theory some states allow you to marry under eighteen, but your parents sign the papers and enter into the contract for you. \u00a0 Animals and non-human objects have no legal standing and can not enter into a contract.<\/p>\n<p>A corporation can enter into a legal contract, but a marriage attempt was found void. I think people marrying corporations would really be the only thing you would have to worry about. \u00a0 Without being able to enter a legal contract (or have red neck crazy parents sign for you) any other scenario would really be null and void.<\/p>\n<p>I promote and live by a pro-equality stance. \u00a0If that means you hate me &#8211; I&#8217;m fine with that. \u00a0If that means you unfriend me on a social network &#8211; do what you feel you to do to sleep well at night. \u00a0I&#8217;ll still be here. \u00a0I won&#8217;t unfriend you for thinking different. \u00a0I will be a constant reminder of the issue just by sitting on your friends list. \u00a0Maybe I can be for you, what the girl on martini night was for me. \u00a0 Anything is possible and society can change.<\/p>\n<p>This is social change that is happening. \u00a0Some people will sit on the sideline. \u00a0They are intimidated and don&#8217;t want to take sides. \u00a0 You could say that these people are still in the closet on this whole issue. I guess this post states which side I am on. \u00a0I stand by my beliefs and think everyone should just believe in the founding founders when they said they hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; The other day I wrote a piece on the Chick-Fil-A item going on around. \u00a0 I did get one fact wrong (and commented on the piece stating as such), that they are a private &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93468,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93467"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93467"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93467\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93468"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93467"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93467"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93467"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
