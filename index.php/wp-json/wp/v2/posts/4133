Now it seems that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn\/content\/article\/2009\/01\/31\/AR2009013101548_pf.html\">states and local governments are fighting for their own ability to do that<\/a>.\u00a0\u00a0 In my previous story, I pointed out how fruitless and ineffective it would truly be during a terrorist attack, I think it&#8217;s insane.\u00a0\u00a0 The question I have now has anyone thought about how this is a terrorist attack against our own people?<\/p>\n<p>The idea of a terrorist is that they use fear as an attack weapon.\u00a0\u00a0 If there is an emergency going on and people can not get through to their loved ones that this wouldn&#8217;t inspire fear.\u00a0\u00a0 Heck, it may scare some people if they can&#8217;t send a message about the emergency to Twitter or <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\">Facebook<\/a>.\u00a0 We&#8217;ve all seen enough movies that we are ingrained as a people that if the enemy is going to attack they will cut off our communications so we can not coordinate a counter-offensive properly.\u00a0\u00a0 This is itself stupid since something will always get through, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00005V9IK?tag=creswor20-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B00005V9IK&amp;adid=10SSM5VPSGF3YHAYJF48&amp;\">Independence Day<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Morse_code\">Morse Code<\/a> maneuver.\u00a0 Yet this would scare and dare I say terrorize people since not only would you be scared since you can&#8217;t call, but no one around you can call and is freaking out also.<\/p>\n<p>This is a sad side effect of living in the era of constant communication, we take it for granted.\u00a0\u00a0 When it would be ripped away from us, we wouldn&#8217;t know what is going on, or what ideas are going to put in our minds.\u00a0 People in the middle of America may think a cell tower is down, what if they drive an hour &#8211; even the most idiotic person isn&#8217;t going to think all the towers are down.\u00a0\u00a0 Some people may think since I&#8217;m saying that the government has an inadvertent take on an idea that could become a terrorist weapon that I&#8217;m a nut job.\u00a0\u00a0 I however think this is a fairly obvious look at human psychology.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from here A few weeks ago I wrote about the NYPD wanting the ability to turn disable cellphone coverage in the case of a terrorist attack.
