I read an article a few years ago about how Goldfish crackers were one of the worst things you can eat and have nothing to offer you other than calories. I couldn&#8217;t find that to link to this post. I did a search and there are many views on both sides of the Goldfish debate. Ever since that article, I have stayed away from them &#8211; until recently.<\/p>\n<p>When I was young I loved Goldfish crackers. My parents didn&#8217;t really buy them for me, it was my grandmother who kept a healthy stock on hand. I started out like every other red-blooded American child with the cheddar version. One day at Rini-Rego I was grocery shopping with my grandmother. I saw them sitting there all cute on the shelf &#8211; pizza flavored Goldfish crackers. I asked my grandmother for them and they started to go into regular rotation for purchase when I was visiting.<\/p>\n<p>While I enjoyed these for years, there was a point when I went years without having them. When I did go back to buy them, they didn&#8217;t exist. Let&#8217;s be a little more specific, the existed &#8211; but they were flavor blasted. Let&#8217;s explain flavor blasting for a minute. What flavor blasting means is adding powder to the outside, upping the salt, and giving you a symptom similar to Cheeto fingers.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of the classic pizza flavor, all that was left was the &#8220;XTREME&#8221; version. I had them occasionally, but they were far from regular rotation of purchases. It was sad, but it was all I had. That was until about a month ago.<\/p>\n<p>I was at the grocery store and I saw they returned this cherished flavor. The extreme edition still exists, but the classic non-finger staining version is back. I bought a bag and it tasted like childhood. Out of all the flavors that Goldfish has ever made, nothing tastes as great as the original pizza. All I need is some Diet Chocolate Faygo to go with it and it tastes like an afternoon at my grandmothers all over again.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; When I was a kid we didn&#8217;t have the debate of whether Goldfish crackers are good for you or not.
