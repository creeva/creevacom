The only ones that kind of count are Baldur&#8217;s Gate: Dark Alliance 1 &amp; 2 for the PS2 which Xie and I played through together and beat. This whole path started 13 years ago in the ancient times of 1998.<\/p>\n<p>One of my friends at the small PC shop I worked out had purchased the game. \u00a0Since I was into Dungeons and Dragons, he thought I would like the game and made copies of the CDs. \u00a0 He was right. \u00a0 Since then I have purchased this exact game 3 times (who says piracy doesn&#8217;t lead to purchase). \u00a0 Xie and I were playing separately and I was in the final city on the final disc of the game (I still don&#8217;t know how close I was to the end I was) then we decided to play through the game cooperatively. \u00a0 This started my downfall of never beating these games.<\/p>\n<p>We started and we both have different play styles. \u00a0When Xie plays a game she is a completest. \u00a0She likes to hit every side quest and makes sure she gets every item for a game. \u00a0 As far as we know the only thing she didn&#8217;t do in Final Fantasy 7 got the gold Chocobo. To her, the game is about the journey. \u00a0I am completely different. \u00a0To me, the game is about the destination. \u00a0 I will do side quests as they come to me and do my best to complete most of the things I find. We played through parts of the game with different friends in co-op mode. \u00a0 Still only getting so far into the game.<\/p>\n<p>I can think of at least 4-5 major play attempts throughout the game. \u00a0All of them start well and sort of fizzle out. \u00a0 We have used Gatekeeper to edit stats, levels, and items to try to make the game easier &#8211; this still has never helped our determination to get through the game. \u00a0 All of that is going to change now. Anyone into retro games knows that getting older games to play on modern systems can be a pain in the ass. \u00a0 When I saw that Baldur&#8217;s Gate was available from Good Old Games I was immediately taken back to the regret of never beating it (they also have the other Bioware Games I listed).<\/p>\n<p>Part of me just wanted to do Icewind Dale so I wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with Imoen, but I needed to do this. \u00a0I needed to beat Baldur&#8217;s Gate. Xie and I discussed it and decided we would play through together &#8211; just power through and get the game off the regret list. \u00a0 We have been looking for something to play together until Star Wars: The Old Republic came out. \u00a0 Good Old Games certified that the games would work on your system. \u00a0This is a half-truth. \u00a0The single-player game (I&#8217;m guessing) works fine. \u00a0The multiplayer game however was a completely different issue. \u00a0 Either way, Good Old Games received my 9.99. I downloaded the game and installed it on my desktop (Windows 7 64-Bit (Xie has the same)).<\/p>\n<p>I spent about an hour rerolling stats in the character creation to get attributes I would not regret. \u00a0Xie did the same thing. \u00a0We had our characters it was now time to connect to a multiplayer game. \u00a0 Whenever I clicked to start a new multiplayer game, it crashed. \u00a0I attempted to run it as admin and in different compatibility modes. \u00a0Nothing was working. \u00a0 It turns out the DirectX drivers changed in Vista and the multiplayer would not work properly. \u00a0 To start a multiplayer game you had to launch it in windowed mode (alt+enter). \u00a0 Having gotten past this hurdle we then tried to connect the games together. \u00a0No luck. \u00a0 We then went back to researching.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out this is a common problem (again in the post-Vista age). \u00a0 We verified all firewalls and security software were disabled. \u00a0 We edited the Baldur&#8217;s Gate ini files as a few posts described. \u00a0I discovered the IPX\/SPX is no longer included in Windows 7. \u00a0In the end, I spent around 4 hours (5 if you count character creation) trying to get a game started. \u00a0 It just couldn&#8217;t be done in any easy way that I could find. There was a total conversion created for Baldur&#8217;s Gate 2 that allowed you to play through Baldur&#8217;s Gate original with the Baldur&#8217;s Gate 2 engine (Baldur&#8217;s Gate Tutu). \u00a0 Some people said they had better luck at creating multiplayer with this method. \u00a0 So I purchased BG2 (another 9.99) and started the download.<\/p>\n<p>It was going to take a few hours so I was done for the night. \u00a0 Dreams of sugar plums and magic missiles danced in my head. \u00a0 Getting up the next morning I made Lex breakfast and installed BG2 and both desktops. \u00a0I then attempted to create a multiplayer game. \u00a0I had the same issue with having to enter windowed mode otherwise starting the multiplayer would crash the game. \u00a0 Working around this I managed to get it started on my computer. \u00a0I then went to Xie&#8217;s computer to connect&#8230;..Nothing.<\/p>\n<p>I was having the same issue that I had with BG1. The normal person would have given up at this point. \u00a0 Unfortunately, I am an alpha geek that will get obsessed with a task like this until I get it going. \u00a0 If I was going to chase this down and get this going and go through any more pain I was going to play on my laptop (Mac Book Pro). \u00a0 Now it might seem insane if I wasn&#8217;t getting it working on the Windows desktop that I would attempt to get it working on OSX. \u00a0The solution I was going to have to deal with was going to be the same &#8211; so I may as well-doing gaming on a machine that is not designed for gaming. \u00a0Geek logic at it&#8217;s finest.<\/p>\n<p>I downloaded Oracle&#8217;s free Virtualbox frontend, dug out an Old XP CD, and went to town. \u00a0 In less than an hour I had XP installed on my Mac Book with Baldur&#8217;s Gate installed and running. \u00a0 Then I discovered the next hurdle. When you made the game full screen in virtual box it took up a little 320&#215;240 window with a black border larger than the screen around it. \u00a0 I could play it in a window and then scale the window &#8211; but at this point, the mouse went all weird and stuttering. \u00a0 I knew we couldn&#8217;t play like this. \u00a0The original Baldur&#8217;s Gate doesn&#8217;t allow you to change screen resolutions so again I was SOL. \u00a0 At this point, I loaded up BG2 and installed Baldur&#8217;s Gate Tutu conversion. \u00a0 Now I could switch to 1024&#215;768 and switch to full-screen mode. \u00a0For all intents and purposes, it covered the complete height and I just had black bars on the left and right sides.<\/p>\n<p>Baldur&#8217;s Gate was not written to take advantage of wide-screen monitors, so this was going to be what it was. \u00a0 I started Baldur&#8217;s Gate 2 and made sure it was running at a playable speed and it ran as fast as I remembered. \u00a0 \u00a0I spent another hour or so getting it up and running on Xie&#8217;s laptop. \u00a0 We are something like 10 hours into this adventure and we hadn&#8217;t even started playing yet. Since the BG1 Tutu version used the BG2 engine, it had additional character creation options.<\/p>\n<p>We opted to spend another hour rerolling characters to get the perfect stats that we wanted to play with, launched the multiplayer game and it connected flawlessly. \u00a0To sum up &#8211; we are playing a 13-year-old game, using an 11-year-old game engine, in a ten-year-old operating system in an emulator, on a laptop with 7-month-old technology, running an operating system that is a little over a month old. \u00a0 Geek kludge working at its finest. \u00a0 Where there is a will there is a way.<\/p>\n<p>I was playing a thief and Xie was playing a cleric. \u00a0We were soon in Candlekeep running around killing rats, getting antidotes for cows, and playing go-get before watching our adopter father being killed on the way to the next town. \u00a0 We managed to clear off two and a half screens that night. \u00a0When we managed to make it to the Friendly Arm Inn we killed the assassin that was gunning for us and locked Xzar and Montaran in a house (removing them from our party with the option of finding them again). \u00a0 We called it a night.<\/p>\n<p>Last night added Khalid and Jaheira to the party and headed south to Beregost. \u00a0Beregost is a huge map and is known to be buggy with the Tutu conversion. \u00a0I did get a patch for the city and so far it seems to be working fine. \u00a0I haven&#8217;t had any issues. \u00a0 We have cleared off most of that map examining most of the houses. \u00a0 We are trying to keep our reputation up so I&#8217;m not lockpicking any chests around NPCs (seems to fail and call the guards 85% of the time). \u00a0We added Garrick to our party and marched him back to the Friendly Arm to lock him away.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, Xie wanted to play a mage, and we had room in the party and would only be a single level ahead of her. \u00a0So Xie dropped out and created a new high-stat mage to add to the party, replacing the spot that we just cleared for Garrick. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not sure we will ever be bringing Garrick back into the group since he doesn&#8217;t have any open side quests to complete. We then went back to work in Beregost clearing the map. \u00a0We found Kagain (whom I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve found in previous run-throughs) and dropped off Imoen at his house. \u00a0We have to go back and show him the broken caravan. \u00a0At this point, it was 1 AM last night and we didn&#8217;t feel like continuing. \u00a0 We called it a night, we will see what tonight holds.<\/p>\n<p>This time I am going to beat this game. \u00a0If a hurricane blows away my house (highly unlikely since I live in Ohio) I will still put the pieces back together enough to beat this game. \u00a0 Right now I&#8217;m even considering emailing save games to myself just to ensure against any hard drive crashes. \u00a0 I want to get through this game once and for all. \u00a0I&#8217;ll keep the blog updated on this for those that care (all 1.5 of you).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Baldur&#8217;s Gate is a game that has tortured me since it came in 1998. \u00a0 It&#8217;s the game I have always wanted to beat but never have. \u00a0 \u00a0Part of that is my fault, and &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":101004,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/74614"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=74614"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/74614\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/101004"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=74614"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=74614"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=74614"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
