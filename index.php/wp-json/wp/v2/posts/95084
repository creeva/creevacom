\u00a0 What if I wanted to play music that was directly on my phone?<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the complication. \u00a0 IOS devices can Airplay out, but only to one remote zone at a time. \u00a0 So if you wanted to use whole house audio at my location, you are stuck with using iTunes. \u00a0 \u00a0It can be a bit limiting sometimes. \u00a0 What I want is something I will refer to as an amplification proxy. \u00a0 The iPhone (or iTunes) could connect to this single zone. \u00a0 Once it was connected to this single receiver &#8211; it could then take the single stream and turn it into three, four, or ten streams (depending on how many zones you have). \u00a0 However, there doesn&#8217;t seem to a product out there.<\/p>\n<p>There are ways to trick Airplay to work across subnet since it was originally designed to be local subnets only. \u00a0 I thought this would be my ticket to getting this done, but this software doesn&#8217;t seem to have any method to turn a single stream into multiple. \u00a0 There is another piece of software called Airfoil that is a paid software. \u00a0 It allows you take the audio output of any Mac or Windows program and send it to Airplay speakers. \u00a0 \u00a0Then they have a separate piece of software that turns the system into a receiver and then pumps it out to the main software all over again. \u00a0 I may actually turn to this, but my problem is that I have to get two pieces of software to work in a wonky scenario.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately I would love a solution that I could run an a Raspberry Pi. \u00a0It would give me an excuse to buy a new one. \u00a0 I would rather use a homebrew solution and spend the money on hardware, than to buy a piece of software. \u00a0 Everything I have heard about Airfoil sounds great, but it would be better if a single software package could handle both sides of the equation.<\/p>\n<p>So my question to you Internet community &#8211; do you know of a write-up that covers how to do this easily? \u00a0 I know someone else will find this post through Google and see that I also don&#8217;t have an answer, but maybe they will closer than I am. \u00a0 I&#8217;m also hoping my fellow geeks on Twitter or Facebook will see this and it will remind them of something and they can point me in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Anyone?
