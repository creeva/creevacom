step-father had tried to correct but couldn&#8217;t do anything &#8220;because it&#8217;s a mac&#8221;.\u00a0\u00a0 I knew there was a reason I don&#8217;t talk to that side of the family.\u00a0\u00a0 Currently, my &#8220;regular&#8221; computing devices include &#8211; XP Desktop for work, Mac Air Book 10.5 for work, Hardy Heron Laptop for myself,\u00a0 XP desktop for home games and movies, and a Windows 2k3 server for home.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My micro OSes include Maemo on my soon-to-be-delivered n810 and Palm OS and my TX.<\/p>\n<p>At work I&#8217;m the main person to say that Mac is not built for the enterprise, they have poorly designed business software when it comes to managing a mixed environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Now the argument back is that Microsoft should make tools to manage Macs, I believe for acceptance in the full enterprise that needs to be reversed.\u00a0\u00a0 Apple needs to roll over backward to fit itself in, I mean I have an easier time working with Linux in an enterprise environment than with Mac.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ironic thing is I never heard anyone ever say &#8220;Linux just works&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>My stepfather is scared of alternative Operating Systems, like the big scary Mac.\u00a0 It took my wife and me a total of 15 minutes in which she used her N810 tethered via Bluetooth to her phone to google the questions I asked her.\u00a0 She fed me back the information after she filtered it and bang &#8211; working networking.<\/p>\n<p>If you are not willing to work out of your comfort zone and approach new things, you will never grow.\u00a0\u00a0 This means no matter how you look on the outside and what your resume says about you, like sitting down at the 10.3.2 desktop and not noticing anything different, you still need to be upgraded or replaced.\u00a0\u00a0 At this point, you are no longer truly useful except for some obscure things and can not compete in modern thought.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sometimes things aren&#8217;t obvious being obsolete in the world of computers.\u00a0 If you are a Windows user it&#8217;s completely obvious that you are using an older version of windows immediately when you start using it.\u00a0\u00a0 &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":99276,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2767"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2767"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2767\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/99276"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2767"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2767"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2767"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
