I want everything to work together better, we want to build to the future, and I have to spend my budget before the end of the fiscal cycle and want to try out this product. \u00a0\u00a0 Hard answers include we want something more manageable for our IT staff, we want it to run faster in our environment, and we want something we can understand.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are reasons that these are easy answers and hard answers.\u00a0 The first and foremost thought is to remember to sit down with a consultant or someone who understands the technology thoroughly enough before ever sitting down with a salesperson.\u00a0\u00a0 To salespeople, these are all easy and correct answers.\u00a0\u00a0 They will tell you your toast can be used to transport computer network traffic with the right purchase, they are there to get your money.\u00a0 It&#8217;s the one reason I can never be a salesperson.\u00a0 I like people using the correct solution, not necessarily the solution that I am selling.\u00a0\u00a0 Even when I worked at Symantec, I knew Symantec products were not the best products for all customers.\u00a0\u00a0 Some customers only changed products because they had money to spend and ended up worse off for it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Salespeople are tricky creatures that guard their bonuses like Disney guards its copyrights.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Easy answers are normally very vague,\u00a0 they tell a salesperson or consultant that you haven&#8217;t really thought too much about the problem.\u00a0 You have a basic idea of what you want, but you don&#8217;t know any specifics.\u00a0 The problem with the easy answers is that they are also the most expensive answers &#8211; this allows those that are implementing something to sell you what they think is best, regardless of how it will fit into your business six months down the road when they are gone.\u00a0 You will have to make some decisions on your own, and this should not be listening to the best sales pitch from two competing vendors.\u00a0 The best sales pitch does not necessarily equate to the best product.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Why are the hard answers difficult?\u00a0 That&#8217;s because everything is relative.\u00a0\u00a0 Going back to my examples can show you this.\u00a0 We want something more manageable for our IT staff, well how trained is your IT staff?\u00a0\u00a0 Do your employees know alternative operating systems?\u00a0 Does your staff only run Microsoft products?\u00a0 Is this faster for your environment?\u00a0 What about a year down the road and the nightmare efficient system breaks because of infrastructure changes you were forced to make?\u00a0 Everything comes down to you knowing your environment and your plans for the future.\u00a0\u00a0 A consultant only gets a glimpse of time into your configuration and is not going to be the full-time employee running this stuff.\u00a0\u00a0 They won&#8217;t know how your future plans could be affected if you don&#8217;t tell them your future plans.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The correct answer?\u00a0 That includes being as specific as possible.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s say this is to implement an Exchange Server migrating from a Lotus Notes architecture.\u00a0\u00a0 Why would I want to do this?\u00a0\u00a0 Lotus Notes has been long in the process of being a headache for us.\u00a0\u00a0 The administrator that runs it is retiring in six months and we have other employees that could scale up quickly to learn\u00a0 Exchange and then Lotus Notes.\u00a0\u00a0 The collaborative features in exchange work in Outlook, which our company already loads on all the desktops since we have a full Microsoft Office License on all of the desktops.\u00a0 About 30% of our users already use outlook to retrieve their e-mail, even though they all have the Notes client installed on their desktops also.\u00a0\u00a0 Being able to consolidate this would save us thousands a year since we would no longer need a support contract or license fees paid to IBM to support the old Lotus infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The more complete and specific the answer, the better the consultant can answer your questions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Do You Listen To Alternatives?<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Even in the Exchange scenario seems complete.\u00a0 How rigid are you to suggestions?\u00a0 What if the consultant offers up other alternatives such as a web-based e-mail solution that would still allow Exchange to connect and retrieve e-mail? While a Linux\/Apache approach may be cheaper, you could also implement it on top of IIS.\u00a0\u00a0 Building with some other technologies you could gain all the collaborative powers of Exchange for thousands of dollars less.\u00a0\u00a0 Those who didn&#8217;t want to use Outlook could use a browser.\u00a0 If you combine this with a secure remote access solution this would allow for a possible quicker and less bandwidth connection for telecommuters if that is where your company is going.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Knowing what your plans are and how rigid they need to help a consultant decide what avenues may be the best approach for you.\u00a0 While I offered up a free solution, another consultant may offer ways to augment your current Notes infrastructure to fit your needs.\u00a0 The best consultants will offer alternatives to your current line of thinking.\u00a0\u00a0 You do not have to listen to them, and you can stay focused, but hearing how open you are is important.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Timeline<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A timeline is something you should have in mind sitting down with the consultant.\u00a0 He needs to know deadlines and what your expectations are.\u00a0\u00a0 Does this need to be done in a week or a year?\u00a0 How are your current employees going to ramp up on the new solution?\u00a0 While a consultant may reset your timelines to something more realistic, knowing what type of time frame you are trying to achieve is important to the success of the project.\u00a0\u00a0 It also tells the consultant if they are going ot need to bring in more outside help.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Breakdown of Tasks<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Have you compartmentalized your tasks?\u00a0 The person that contacted me was looking for a complete end to end solution, is this what best?\u00a0\u00a0 In a solution like that how are you going to handle the transition time?\u00a0\u00a0 You don&#8217;t want to migrate the whole solution at the touch of a button, since any big architecture change can effect your business continuity.\u00a0 For some businesses any downtime at all is lost revenue.\u00a0\u00a0 A consultant wants to make this impact as minimal as possible.\u00a0\u00a0 Even when you do the best planning and compartmentalizing sometimes you will get stuck on a twenty-three hour conference call working through the issues of down time.\u00a0\u00a0 When this happens I can tell you it&#8217;s not fun.\u00a0 That was also with a staged migration.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What segments of your business can be down for hours at a time?\u00a0\u00a0 When you can answer that you can start staging your tasks.\u00a0 The tasks that can be down the longest generally should be the first ones migrated, since they should give you expectations for later tasks, and allow you to plan accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0 Do not re-architect the design so the whole system (no matter how small) to be done in one night if there are multiple groups effected in the transition.\u00a0\u00a0 Design the impact to be as small as possible.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, this may increase time &#8211; which in turn increases expense, but without proper planning it may cost you more in the long run.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Cost<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The question that no likes asking or giving, what is your budget for this task.\u00a0 You can wait for the consultant to make a cost estimate pitch first if you like &#8211; but at some point in the conversation cost is going to come up.\u00a0\u00a0 Do your homework ahead of time to see how much you expect it to cost and budget accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0 What are you going to do if things go over budget?\u00a0 If your three quarters way through a project and haev no more money to finish it, how is that going to impact you?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>In Closing<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This may seem like a list of things that I want as a consultant.\u00a0\u00a0 These are however fairly common truths on what a consultant needs to start a project properly instead of spinning their wheels.\u00a0\u00a0 In the next week or so I&#8217;m going to follow this up with how to spot a good consultant versus a bad one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Someone I know came to me the other day about a consulting project that may or may not happen.\u00a0\u00a0 What essentially he wants to be done is an overhaul of IT infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0 They want more &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":102917,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4172"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=4172"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/4172\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/102917"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=4172"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=4172"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=4172"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
