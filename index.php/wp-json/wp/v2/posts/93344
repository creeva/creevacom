WTF? \u00a0IT&#8217;S ASKING FOR THE PAIRING CODE AGAIN.<\/p>\n<p>I head back to the interwebs to find the proper pairing codes. \u00a0It turns out all the pairing codes as useless. \u00a0By default this will happen every time with the bluetooth 4.0 drivers in the 2011 Macbook pro. \u00a0 \u00a0There is a work around.<\/p>\n<p>Before you get to the steps below you must get your PS3 controller into pairing mode. \u00a0 To do this plug-in the PS3 controller to the USB port of your Mac. \u00a0 Then you should hit the power button on the controller. \u00a0 Unplug the controller and it will be in pairing mode. \u00a0 Once your bluetooth is detecting your PS3 follow the instructions I found below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/forums.macrumors.com\/showthread.php?t=1202616\">Mark427 from a forum had this information to add<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>1. Open bluetooth from system preferences.<br \/>\n2. Get your PS3 controller to ask for pairing passcode (pressing PSX button). 3. Then enter new passcode (I used letters only &#8220;xxxx&#8221; don&#8217;t know if it matters)<br \/>\n4. Now you should see PS3 Controller &#8220;Connected&#8221; in that list of Bluetooth devices. Select it and click the little gear in the bottom left corner and select add to favorites and then update services.<br \/>\n5. THIS IS THE STEP THAT FINALLY MADE IT REMEMBER. Turn off Bluetooth right away before it asks to pair all over again. The lights on the controller should stop flashing. Turn Bluetooth back on.<br \/>\n6. Press PSX button once and should pair in bluetooth right away. The lights will start flashing again and stay flashing all the time. They turn off when you disconnect it from bluetooth or turn bluetooth off.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>If these steps don&#8217;t work for you, I can&#8217;t help you. \u00a0 I almost think this works through the power of fairy dust or prayer. \u00a0 So many people have had issues getting the PS3 controller to work with the bluetooth 4.0 chipset. \u00a0 Another item of note, your PS3 controller indicator will be blinking on all four LEDs. \u00a0 This behavior seems to be\u00a0normal.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from Wikipedia I know most people don&#8217;t care about this post, but I don&#8217;t want to ever hunt for the information again. \u00a0 Hopefully this helps someone out.
