I was freaking out thinking some process had magically deleted them. Then I noticed the partition was missing. I spent a few days banging my head against the wall trying to recover the data and nothing helped. Since I&#8217;m a listener of <a href=\"http:\/\/twit.tv\/sn\">Security Now<\/a>, I attempted to use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.grc.com\/spinrite.htm\">Spin Rite<\/a> on the drive, even this didn&#8217;t help it. I was freaking out.<\/p>\n<p>I set aside the drive and re-addressed it yesterday. A friend of mine had a copy of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ptdd.com\/\">Partition Doctor 3.5<\/a> and we ran it against my drive. In a matter of minutes, we managed to get the drive back up and all of the MP3s were there. Neither my wife nor I were too anxious to go through the 2-3 week ripping process we did last time when we re-ripped at a higher bit rate.<\/p>\n<p>This is not a promotion, I get no money from the links you click, if however, you do have an issue with a lost windows partition, try Partition Doctor&#8217;s demo version and it will show you if it can be recovered.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here A few months ago my home server lost all of my MP3s from a share.
