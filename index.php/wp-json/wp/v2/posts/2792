I was going to be out with a few hours to kill, and I didn&#8217;t take my Mac Book with me. During my hour commute to work, I listened to a couple of episodes of &#8220;Cranky Geeks&#8221; with John Dvorak. In the afternoon I had to go to the lab and do some testing with users. While waiting for the users to show up I decided to take my N810 onto the guest wifi. While doing that I installed <a href=\"http:\/\/maemo.org\/downloads\/product\/vim\/\">Vim<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/fl0rian.wordpress.com\/2007\/01\/08\/gpe-pim-for-n800-maemo-30\/\">GPE suite<\/a>. I&#8217;m going to be working on getting the GPE calendar to sync with Google Calendar. I should have realized that vim was a command line-only utility since it was a port. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to stay using it though, I know vim is the more friendly vi, but I have a severe hatred of vi. I think it&#8217;s the difference of growing up with the extremely easy-to-use Microsoft Edit in DOS that vi seems so hackneyed to me.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that was an issue for me yesterday was I installed the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/garage.maemo.org\/projects\/camera\/\">Camera<\/a>&#8221; application from the repositories. I installed and saw how a picture would look, then I clicked the folderesque button on the lower right-hand side and that locked up my N810. I tried to hold the power button down that didn&#8217;t do anything, after about 5 minutes of waiting I yanked the battery. In that 5 minutes, I went from 75% of my battery to 25%, so whatever happened taxed the hell out of the CPU and storage space. Needless to say that application is not staying around.<\/p>\n<p>I then went up to Vermilion and met with my sisters and had some pizza, after that, I wandered to the local library and decided I was going to attempt to get some work done. I managed to log in to my work&#8217;s exchange webmail, I wrote a full blog using maemo-wordpy, and used it happily as an MP3 player listening to my podcasts. Writing a longer-length blog post took some time compared to what it would take with a normal keyboard. However, I managed to get it done and my typing skills are definitely improving on the N810 keyboard as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>The annoying things I found out yesterday.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Vermilion Public Library&#8217;s Public Wifi doesn&#8217;t allow IMAP &#8211; grrrr no Gmail via Claws for me at that time<\/li>\n<li>Canola won&#8217;t &#8220;save&#8221; songs to scrobble at a later time, if it doesn&#8217;t have a network connection you are SOL &#8211; grrrr &#8211; does anyone know if Maemo scrobbler will save before submission?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So last night was a work in progress\/real-world scenario time.
