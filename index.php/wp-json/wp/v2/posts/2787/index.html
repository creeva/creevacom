Are you hear to make a quick buck? If you have investors in you then you stand to make an immediate living in it. For the ones that aren\u2019t making their dream income, do you continue writing in the hope of eventually getting a payday? Would you still do it if you knew it was never going to come?<\/p>\n<p>The reason I ask is that I noticed one of the sites that I followed last year was in a nomination as being one of the best new blogs. As of March 25th, the site has not seen an update. I know one of the writers and I haven\u2019t asked him about this, but I do know he is actively working on a new site.<\/p>\n<p>I understand about stopping when you run out of funding, but do you make a run at something build up equity, and leave it hanging?

If you disappear and they notice you started another blog without telling them, how long are they going to continue to trust you?<\/p>\n<p>This is the wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing, they made their money and moved on to the next project. I\u2019m not going to preach that there is anything wrong with that, but I will state that it isn\u2019t the nicest thing to do.<\/p>\n<p>Your opinions?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why do you blog?
