I&#8217;m as bad as anyone. I&#8217;m speaking of this after a true friend added me yesterday on <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\">Facebook<\/a>. It&#8217;s someone I messaged back and forth a few times with, and may mildly keep in touch with. After that I went through my graduating class and added more people. Some people I&#8217;m interested in from afar, some I&#8217;m interested in communicating with, some I have a passing interest in. I also didn&#8217;t add a few that I wouldn&#8217;t be interested in, but I would friend them back if they connected to me.<\/p>\n<p>I was thinking afterward though that just like high school, some of these bonds and connections are true and some of them just a passing fancy where no communication will ever really flow from one end to the other. I see people that I know vaguely, I&#8217;m at least proper enough to stick with people I actually had classes or conversations with. Some of these people only have friends that they went to high school with. Some I may be the only one.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at the sociological dynamics is very interesting. Some people are extremely close with those they went to high school with. I&#8217;m not, mostly since I&#8217;ve fallen out of touch with a lot of people. Moving to Oregon also put a bit more space between me and the rest of the class, and even now I live about sixty miles away &#8211; though I play in the community band in that town.<\/p>\n<p>Even the bullies, the preps, or the prima donnas from school, I wish them no ill will. There was a moment in time I was worried about my standing in the social pecking order, but I think I left that behind when I was an underclassmen in high school. I&#8217;m someone that cares about my immediate social circles and not those of memories of people over a decade old. If they however wish to know me more in depth then my blog posts allow I&#8217;m happy to converse with them, maybe even have a coffee &#8211; but things won&#8217;t be like they were. Because of that I don&#8217;t judge them by the way they are.<\/p>\n<p>Time has changed most if not all of us. I&#8217;m sure some of them all hang out with the same people from high school, get drunk every night with the same people they drank with when they were underage- but I hope the majority of them have moved from that. That their dreams have been realized. We have this spark of moment in time where we had a shared experience and it bounds us. Not everyone is brave enough to face that moment in their lives, some people want to leave it behind them never to return back. I&#8217;m sure those people I&#8217;ll never be able to reconnect with, the saddest part a couple of those were some of my best friends.<\/p>\n<p>To the future and the past, we move forward solid in our own steps. The echoes of the past follow behind us as we make our way into the unknown.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You ever notice that when you are on social networks that you seem to seek people out that you only have the most tentative of connections with.
