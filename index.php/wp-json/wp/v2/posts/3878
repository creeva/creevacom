though I play in the community band in that town.<\/p>\n<p>Even the bullies, the preps, or the prima donnas from school, I wish them no ill will.\u00a0 There was a moment in time I was worried about my standing in the social pecking order, but I think I left that behind when I was an underclassmen in high school.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m someone that cares about my immediate social circles and not those of memories of people over a decade old.\u00a0\u00a0 If they however wish to know me more in depth then my blog posts allow I&#8217;m happy to converse with them, maybe even have a coffee &#8211; but things won&#8217;t be like they were.\u00a0 Because of that I don&#8217;t judge them by the way they are.<\/p>\n<p>Time has changed most if not all of us.\u00a0 I&#8217;m sure some of them all hang out with the same people from high school, get drunk every night with the same people they drank with when they were underage- but I hope the majority of them have moved from that.\u00a0\u00a0 That their dreams have been realized.\u00a0\u00a0 We have this spark of moment in time where we had a shared experience and it bounds us.\u00a0\u00a0 Not everyone is brave enough to face that moment in their lives, some people want to leave it behind them never to return back.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m sure those people I&#8217;ll never be able to reconnect with, the saddest part a couple of those were some of my best friends.<\/p>\n<p>To the future and the past, we move forward solid in our own steps.\u00a0\u00a0 The echoes of the past follow behind us as we make our way into the unknown.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You ever notice that when you are on social networks that you seem to seek people out that you only have the most tentative of connections with.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m as bad as anyone.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;m speaking of &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3878"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3878"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3878\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3878"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3878"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3878"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
