The high water mark was going to see The Martian in the movie theater. Anything better than that was doable (though we have heard really good things about The Martian). While in the planning stages we looked at what concerts were going on. Soul Asylum and The Meat Puppets were playing in Dayton. Tickets were 30.00 &#8211; it was better than The Martian. Guess we were going to a concert.<\/p>\n<p>Dayton is about two and half hours away from us. This isn&#8217;t a terrible drive, it is about the same as we would make if we were driving to Detroit. We just hadn&#8217;t done the full Dayton drive. We visit a nearby town to Dayton about once a year &#8211; but this was the first time I think I have spent anytime in Dayton proper. The drive was a monotonous, soul crushing two hours. It wasn&#8217;t about the distance or the time, it was solely on the boringness of the highways you take to get there. From that perspective I really prefer driving to Detroit. At least part of that drive is interesting.<\/p>\n<p>Highways aside we arrived in Dayton early to get some shopping done (which didn&#8217;t come to any fruition) and get dinner. We browsed the Dayton Mall and then had dinner at the Rusty Bucket. They advertise that all their food is made from scratch with fresh ingredients (with the exception of fries). I had the Italian Torpedo, it was pretty good &#8211; but felt like something was missing in the taste profile. We finished up and headed fifteen minutes across town to the venue, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oddbodys.com\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Oddbody&#8217;s Music Room<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.17.27-1-1.jpg\" class=\"broken_link\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94699\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.17.27-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2015-11-07 19.17.27\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.17.27-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.17.27-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.17.27-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.17.27-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.17.27-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>At first we thought we had the wrong location since all we noticed was the Family Dollar, off to the left was the small venue. While this picture truly does not give the venue justice it was a bit strange at first. After having experienced the evening there, I would say this is one of those hidden gem establishments to see bands. The whole place was accessible and easy to get towards the front of the stage. I don&#8217;t know if this show was sold out &#8211; but it was fairly easy to get around.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.18.48-1-1.jpg\" class=\"broken_link\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94701\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.18.48-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2015-11-07 19.18.48\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.18.48-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.18.48-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.18.48-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.18.48-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.18.48-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here is a picture of the interior. The best I could describe it to my friends back in Vermilion, OH was that it was slightly smaller than Commodore&#8217;s Place. As you can see it is much deeper than you would have expected seeing the outside. Now drink choices compared to other venues &#8211; this place does run a bit lean. We asked if they had Patron, no they didn&#8217;t. Ok so we both ordered a Captain and Coke. The flavor was a bit off, but I blamed the mixture of the Coke. When we had a second round, the bartender asked me if Sailor Jerry was ok. Patron, that I can understand that not everyone stocks. Captain Morgan on the other hand, that one was a bit weird.<\/p>\n<p>We did make the joke before we left home that we could wear flannel to the show. We would not have been out of place if we had. Compared to some other concerts we have been to &#8211; we were definitely on the younger side of the crowd. The people that were wearing flannels wore them because they were comfortable. This place didn&#8217;t have the ironic wardrobe stylings of more hipster location that we have been to. It was refreshing to be somewhere completely genuine.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Able Danger<\/h2>\n<p><center><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WUPVi4ZTADY?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/center><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Members of Able Danger: Nikki Luttrell Chris Stewart Ben Willis Jason Winner<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.43.37-1-1.jpg\" class=\"broken_link\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94704\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.43.37-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2015-11-07 19.43.37\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.43.37-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.43.37-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.43.37-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.43.37-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-19.43.37-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The first band was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.abledangermusic.com\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Able Danger.<\/a> Above is the only video I could find of them.

I don&#8217;t mean that in any negative sense. I think they would fit perfect in a place like Now That&#8217;s Class in Cleveland. A small stage and a very close and enthusiastic crowd. Something that was their own where they could be a headliner and have an interaction with the crowd.

When the first one hit the crowd went wild and sang along. When the second one hit the crowd went even more nuts. For a minute I thought they were doing them both to get them out of the way.

It showed off that they are veterans at what they do.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-22.05.23-1-1.jpg\" class=\"broken_link\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94752\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-22.05.23-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"2015-11-07 22.05.23\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-22.05.23-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-22.05.23-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-22.05.23-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-22.05.23-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-22.05.23-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Meat Puppets closed out their set in jam band style with an epically long and awesome version of <em>Lake of Fire<\/em>.

People were mulling about during the sound check, which took the longest of all the acts. While Soul Asylum was the act I was most familiar with, it seems they have a much larger song catalog than I was aware of. One song they didn&#8217;t perform that I was hoping for was <em>Can&#8217;t Even Tell<\/em>. Since it was on the <em>Clerks Soundtrack<\/em>, it is probably my most listened to non-radio Soul Asylum song. I went through a cassette, then a CD, then MP3s of that album.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.13.12-1-1.jpg\" class=\"broken_link\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94773\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.13.12-1-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"2015-11-07 23.13.12\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.13.12-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.13.12-1-300x300.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.13.12-1-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.13.12-1-768x768.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.13.12-1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.13.12-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As far as I&#8217;m concerned <em>Misery<\/em> is the best song that Soul Asylum ever produced.

I was wrong, it was a big tease. Through out the the night he swapped back and forth between electric and acoustic. About the third time is when <em>Runaway Train<\/em> came on. I&#8217;m not quite sure if this was larger hit for them then <em>Misery<\/em> &#8211; but it definitely jogs memories. My senior year we did the yearly band trip to Cedar Point. One of my best friends had a new girlfriend. While they were all cuddly on the bus she went on and on about <em>Runaway Train<\/em> was their song. They were off in a direction and were going to keep going. Needless to say it was just and end of the year infatuation that didn&#8217;t make it the distance. If you look at the music video though, it is mighty strange that this would be anybody&#8217;s song.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.01.08-1-1.jpg\" class=\"broken_link\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94765\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.01.08-1-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"2015-11-07 23.01.08\" width=\"640\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.01.08-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.01.08-1-300x300.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.01.08-1-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.01.08-1-768x768.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.01.08-1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2015-11-07-23.01.08-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The lead singers movements and mannerisms were straight out the of the nineties.
