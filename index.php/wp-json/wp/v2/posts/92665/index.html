I can&#8217;t say I truly remember Bayern Kurve. It get&#8217;s mixed up in my mind (from an experience perspective) with the Trabant and the Himalaya. It is ironic all the family rides that Cedar Point got rid of over the years in the name of coasters. The reason it is ironic is all the focus these days they have on doing family rides.<\/p>\n<p>The Bayern Kurve was installed in the Park as part of the Million Dollar Midway. It was erected in 1970. Other attractions that opened that year were\u00a0WildCat, Dodgem No. 2, Monster, Schwabinchen, Calypso, Super Himalaya, Centennial Theatre, Kiddy Kingdom, and Tiki Twirl.<\/p>\n<p>1984 was the last year for the Bayern Kurve. It was removed from the midway the same year as Earthquake, The Rotor, and The Tiki Twirl. Since I vividly remember Earthquake and The Rotor, I must have ridden this ride. I&#8217;m kind of annoyed that I don&#8217;t remember it better. If you have any more information please leave it in the comments.<\/p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s not Cedar Point&#8217;s, I have a video from Kennywood that shows another Bayern Kurve in operation. I&#8217;m assuming that Cedar Point&#8217;s was mostly the same.<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<\/center><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from Pinterest It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve done a Cedar Point memories post.
