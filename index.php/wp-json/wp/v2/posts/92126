This Last Weekend Part 2"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday I left you at entering the park. \u00a0 Once again it has been six years since I have been to Cedar Point, and there was something I was mentally prepared for &#8211; the loss of the Demon Drop. \u00a0I wasn&#8217;t ready for the loss of it. \u00a0 The effect of the Demon Drop being gone from the entrance &#8220;skyline&#8221; is\u00a0dramatic. \u00a0 Stranger still is the loss of hearing it running as you enter the park. \u00a0 It just felt a little surreal to me.<\/p>\n<p>Just walking around the park, things didn&#8217;t seem to &#8220;pop&#8221; the same way. \u00a0 Part of this could indeed be age, but Cedar Point seems to have lost a bit of its sparkle. \u00a0 You can see the age written across it. \u00a0 I almost wonder if my son will be able to enjoy Cedar Point thirty years from now.<\/p>\n<p>The park was also\u00a0unusually\u00a0empty for a Memorial Day weekend. \u00a0 The big rides would historically have 2-3 hour waits on them. \u00a0 On Sunday and Monday it was about 1 hour waits or less. \u00a0 Very odd for someone who grew up in those long lines. \u00a0 The park has as many people as I would expect on a normal summer afternoon, but not as many as should be there on a holiday weekend.<\/p>\n<p>On Sunday we weren&#8217;t going to ride the rides, we were just going to walk around. \u00a0In hindsight I should have taken the DSLR, but I also wanted the option to be able to get on rides. \u00a0 The first ride I went on were the swings in Frontier Land. \u00a0 I always loved the swings, though when I went on them it was only a quarter full. \u00a0 \u00a0I sat on the outside and managed to kick the leaves above the operator&#8217;s station. \u00a0 Xie watched on eating some frozen custard we picked up.<\/p>\n<p>We moved on to check a show at the theater opposite White Wate&#8230;.The Maverick. \u00a0 The show was good, lacking the polish it will have later in the season, but we enjoyed it. \u00a0 The beer was very expensive. \u00a0We only had a glass each. \u00a0After that we rode the front seat of the Mine Ride. \u00a0 Now Xie and I are in disagreement. \u00a0 She says that it feels the same as it always has. \u00a0 I say it has gotten much rougher than it ever was. \u00a0I try it a few more times this season and see if I can tell if it feels &#8220;right&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I believe the only other thing we rode that day was Disaster Transport. \u00a0 This ride we both agree has gone completely downhill. \u00a0 When it was still Avalanche Run it was one of my favorite rides in the park. \u00a0 \u00a0Now it felt almost as rough as the Mean Streak did when it was new. \u00a0 They also changed where you enter the ride. \u00a0 You do not go through all three themed rooms anymore, just the last one.<\/p>\n<p>After Disaster Transport we decided that it was enough for the day so we went out to eat and visited with a friend. \u00a0 Knowing that we were taking Lex back the next day. \u00a0I would like to mention that there were two other ride closures I noticed. \u00a0 The first I was ready for, Paddlewheel Excursions. \u00a0 I&#8217;ll pine for this in a later post (it was my favorite ride in the park). \u00a0 The second is the Wildcat. \u00a0I can say I&#8217;m actually surprised Cedar Point removed a coaster. \u00a0It will be missed.<\/p>\n<p>Memorial Day rolls around mighty early in the morning. \u00a0 We managed to pick up Lex around 11:30 and headed up to Vermilion to pick up Jason. \u00a0We made it to the park around 2. \u00a0 Lex didn&#8217;t want to get his picture taken at first but finally relented and we were on our way into the park.<\/p>\n<p>While we were waiting for Jason (who went through the season pass line after us) we decided to go into the park. \u00a0 The first thing in front of us was the carousel. \u00a0 So we decided this would be his first ride. \u00a0He was anxious getting on, but we thought he would calm down once the ride started. \u00a0 We sat on one of the bench seats and Lex sat on Xie&#8217;s lap. \u00a0 It was not a good time. \u00a0 He freaked out and we did our best to calm him down. \u00a0 After that Xie promised him that we wouldn&#8217;t make him go on anymore rides without his permission first.<\/p>\n<p>Jason caught up with us and we went over to Kiddy Land. \u00a0 Lex wanted to ride the monster trucks that follow the path like the Cadillac Cars. \u00a0 With this one though there is no steering and no need to hit the gas. \u00a0 He rode this twice. The first time I sat in the back of the truck with him (he&#8217;s too short to ride this one by himself). \u00a0 The second time Xie rode with him. \u00a0After this we cut through the arcade and went to the Snoopy area that overtook Bernstein Bear Country.<\/p>\n<p>There he rode the train and loved it. \u00a0 The first time I rode with him and once later in the day Xie rode with him. \u00a0The rest of the time he figured out how everything works and he rode this three to four more times by himself. \u00a0 This area had a clone ride to the monster trucks in Kiddy Land. \u00a0 I rode through this with him again. \u00a0 Xie also rode the Submarine ride with him.<\/p>\n<p>We then went to the Pizza Hut next to the area. \u00a0This used to be Xie&#8217;s favorite\u00a0restaurant\u00a0in the park, now it&#8217;s a chain store. \u00a0 We shared a supreme pizza, but Lex refused to eat. \u00a0 He was drinking\u00a0continuously so we didn&#8217;t push the issue.<\/p>\n<p>After eating Jason and I took a spin on Max Air. \u00a0 Despite being a &#8220;high thrill ride&#8221;, I found it a leisurely ride that just went really high. \u00a0 It was enjoyable, but not on my &#8220;must hit&#8221; list. \u00a0 I guess while this is going on Lex rode the train a few more times and rode the rockets by himself. \u00a0 We are going to make him a chain rider yet.<\/p>\n<p>We had to drag him away, but he was excited that he got to ride the train from the Midway to Frontier Land. \u00a0 He says that this was his favorite ride in the park. \u00a0 \u00a0Once we got in Frontier Land we rode the Antique Cars as a group. \u00a0 Lex sat in the front with Jason driving. \u00a0Xie and I sat in the back. \u00a0 We then headed back to the candy store and picked up candy.<\/p>\n<p>Lex had his first Starburst. \u00a0 You would think from his reaction that he was in pain and it was the worst thing in the world. \u00a0 He did however want more. \u00a0 The joys of being a kid. \u00a0 Honestly, for a minute there we thought something had gone really really wrong. \u00a0 He was fine though.<\/p>\n<p>We then headed to the kid area by the Gemini. \u00a0 I rode the Snoopy bus with him (same as the submarine in the front). \u00a0 He then rode the Red Baron airplanes by himself. \u00a0 We finished the day attempting to ride the Junior Gemini.<\/p>\n<p>I did manage to get him aboard the Junior Gemini and at first he was excited because he thought it was like a train. \u00a0 I had an issue putting on the seat belt at first. \u00a0 I wouldn&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m skinny, but I&#8217;m not huge. \u00a0 Regardless it was a battle to get the belt on. \u00a0 I swear the parent I saw get off before we rode was larger.<\/p>\n<p>Generally the Junior Gemini makes two trips before finishing the ride. \u00a0 After the first turn Lex freaked. \u00a0 When we made it back to the station the operator asked if they wanted to do it again. \u00a0All the kids yelled yes, except Lex. \u00a0Lex gave a resounding &#8220;NO!&#8221;. \u00a0So the operator let us off. \u00a0 Lex told me the ride went too fast. \u00a0 It&#8217;s a good thing he wasn&#8217;t tall enough for Top Thrill Dragster to be his first coaster.<\/p>\n<p>After that we called it a day. \u00a0We were all exhausted from the heat and chasing a three-year old around the park. \u00a0Lex however had a great time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday I left you at entering the park. \u00a0 Once again it has been six years since I have been to Cedar Point, and there was something I was mentally prepared for &#8211;
