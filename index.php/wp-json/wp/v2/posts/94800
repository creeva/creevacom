since they sacrificed the boat ride for that.<\/p>\n<p>It was a place I used to go and relax. \u00a0 I rarely ever rode it by myself, most of my friends were into it also. \u00a0 It all started the summer of 1993. \u00a0 One of my female friends was dating Captain D of the Paddle Ride. \u00a0 Because of that we hopelessly looped it, sometimes just riding that ride all day. \u00a0At some point it became an obsession.<\/p>\n<p>A year or two ago I purchased the operators manual for Paddle Wheel excursions. \u00a0It included how to operate the boat, and the script for the ride. \u00a0 While there were certain parts of the ride that had specific dialogue, the jokes were mostly free form. \u00a0You could always tell a good captain based on how they deviated from the script. \u00a0When you ruined the jokes by shouting the punchline, the good captains would know the alternate lines to feed back. \u00a0 It was great when it was a cooperative effort between the crowd and the captain.<\/p>\n<p>They still have at least one of the boats. \u00a0It does tours around Lake Erie. \u00a0 I can&#8217;t bring myself to do the extra fee to take it. \u00a0 There are no animatronics. \u00a0I&#8217;m sure the ride is more of a site seeing adventure than a show. \u00a0I&#8217;m sure any witty banter is gone and never to return. \u00a0 That&#8217;s the problem though &#8211; it&#8217;s gone. \u00a0It&#8217;s something I will always remember fondly. \u00a0 A moment of time that can only be captured and reflected upon &#8211; when you see a guy trying to fly a plane on a bicycle. \u00a0 Even though you know it&#8217;s never going to happen, part of you deep inside, hopes this is the time. \u00a0 This is the time that I will see it happen. \u00a0I will hold onto the feeling &#8211; that next year is the year it will return. \u00a0 If not, I will hope for all the years after that.<\/p>\n<p>Until that time, I&#8217;m guess I&#8217;m just going to have to sit here and drink my swine cooler and reminisce.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
