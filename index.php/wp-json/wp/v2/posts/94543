Cleveland that runs together with Lakewood and it&#8217;s hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. \u00a0 The culture and the neighborhood reflects this congregation of space. \u00a0 Earlier this year we made our first visit to this space to see the Screaming Females. \u00a0It&#8217;s small and while extremely interesting, space is tight. \u00a0 The venue is great for concerts &#8211; not so great for browsing a flea market selection.<\/p>\n<p>After we parked the car we spotted a Resident Evil themed crossover. \u00a0It was even complete enough to blood splatter and the rear bumper. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t know that\u00a0I was going to write this piece, but I&#8217;m glad I took a couple of pictures of the vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>Outside were booths carrying a large range of\u00a0custom flasks, another was selling gothic dresses, and a third was selling masks and custom artwork repurposed from Goodwill paintings. \u00a0 Walking in the dark space we were greeted by someone handing out free reusable totes. \u00a0 Xie and Carebear each took a bag, I opted to pass. \u00a0These bags are still sitting on the rear window deck of my car. \u00a0 Inside we made it through psychics giving readings in the side booths. \u00a0 They all looked the part and the patrons seemed deeply invested in their futures. \u00a0 The next couple booths sold baked goods in Halloween themes. \u00a0 We pushed through the crowd that was shopping and consuming\u00a0their favorite libations \u00a0to get to the next room which held the stage.<\/p>\n<p>Waiting our turn as people made it through the short tight hallway felt like being in a sea of people. \u00a0 You would think that a band was playing and you were vying for the chance to get to the front of stage. \u00a0 In different areas you found pockets of freedom from the crowd. \u00a0These were spots you get stretch your arms and not hit anyone, but not much more space than that. \u00a0 These spots actually were few and far between.<\/p>\n<p>We went around the room counter-clockwise. \u00a0The first booth was handmade decorations. \u00a0There was a coffin-shaped end table that caught Xie&#8217;s eye. \u00a0 It was roughly made and had a glass top. \u00a0Beneath the glass was pictures of different horror icons (Freddy, Jason, Pennywise, etc.). \u00a0 They wanted 70.00 for the table and we were considering it. \u00a0We wanted to continue browsing first before committing to anything. \u00a0The next booth was a guy in a gorilla mask selling B-Movies. \u00a0I&#8217;m not sure if these were films he made himself or if they if they were something to MST3k.<\/p>\n<p>The next booth had homemade gothic jewelry. \u00a0 There was some interesting pieces, but nothing that jumped out as a purchase. \u00a0The last booth in the half-circle mostly focused on buttons and couple other things. \u00a0 Since the early 90&#8217;s have ended, I&#8217;m not a big button wearer. \u00a0 I think the last time I wore a significant amount of buttons was on my varsity jacket. \u00a0 We are over twenty years away from that being worn more than once here are there for the hell of it. \u00a0Needless to say we didn&#8217;t buy anything there. \u00a0 But, they did have a few interesting buttons for those that keep them in fashion rotation.<\/p>\n<p>The next booth we ran across was a taxidermy booth. \u00a0 They had to have at least 50 small animals or skeletons on display. \u00a0 I know there is a subset of people that enjoy this, but I don&#8217;t get it. \u00a0 I have no idea on prices or what items like those are even worth. \u00a0 They did not seem to be doing a quick turnover of inventory. \u00a0Even in this crowd it seemed to have limited appeal.<\/p>\n<p>On the stage was a vendor selling masks, posters, and old magazines. \u00a0 You would think that the most common type of magazines would be Fangoria or Starlog. \u00a0 Magazines that specialize in horror or special effects would do well you. \u00a0There were rows and rows of Playboys though. \u00a0 They were in the long cartons and a mass collection from someone long ago. \u00a0 I guess from growing up and being a regular visitor at Jamie&#8217;s Flea Market for comic book, I should be used to this sight. \u00a0It just felt a bit out place in the limited room that made up this flea market.<\/p>\n<p>I made a comment to Xie that I wasn&#8217;t going to climb up on\u00a0the stage. \u00a0 \u00a0I believe I said I was too old to bother. \u00a0 The guy running a lower booth (I don&#8217;t know if it was the same vendor or not since it ran together) said he understood. \u00a0 We weren&#8217;t as young as we once were. \u00a0 For me though, it was mostly because nothing looked that appealing to dig through. \u00a0This guy then proceeded to try to sell me 1\/8 of a coffin. \u00a0 It literally was the end of a coffin cut off. \u00a0 I politely declined, but he did offer to help me carry it out. \u00a0 Time to move along.<\/p>\n<p>At this point we were back waiting for a space to make it out through the narrow hallway again. \u00a0 To make matters worse there was a narrow stairwell in the middle of the hallway with more vendors down stairs. \u00a0It was a lesson in patience to wait for a break in the hallway and then a break in people coming up the stairs to make it down.<\/p>\n<p>There were about 5-6 vendors downstairs. \u00a0We continued our flow of counter-clockwise through the room. \u00a0 The first vendor had Halloween based crafts. \u00a0There was knitting and painted porcelain. \u00a0The big thing was about 2-3 creepy dolls. \u00a0 Xie has wanted to get into creepy doll collecting for a while now. \u00a0 Most of the time we almost purchase them, they are just old and gothic dolls that have something off about them. \u00a0 These dolls however were repainted and dyed up to be even creepier. \u00a0 We asked the price (40.00 each) and admired them. \u00a0 We then moved to the next booth.<\/p>\n<p>We were torn at this point. \u00a0 Coffin table or Creepy Doll, we had no reason to buy both. \u00a0 Xie decide to go with the purchase of the creepy doll. \u00a0We went back to the booth and looked at the three. \u00a0 This was the one she chose:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-94544\"

\u00a0 We finally had a creepy doll in the house to call our own.<\/p>\n<p>Since we had a purchase none of the remaining vendors in the basement stood out so much. \u00a0 There was a guy selling VHS tapes and the Star Wars collection caught my eye &#8211; but I already own the same collection. \u00a0 We managed to slowly make our way out of the place. \u00a0 \u00a0If it hadn&#8217;t been so crowded we might have stopped for a drink. \u00a0 The crowd however was a bit much to try to stand around and hang out. \u00a0 On another note though, I did see someone actually taking that 1\/8 coffin out to their car. \u00a0 I guess that guy finally did make his sale.<\/p>\n<p>We have shown it off to a few people. \u00a0Some love, some don&#8217;t see the point, others thought we paid too much. \u00a0 Everyone has a unique feel and identity they get from it. \u00a0 No one has hated it, but I&#8217;m sure there are people out there with a fear of creepy dolls. \u00a0We are lucky that our son is not afraid of the doll. \u00a0He is still at the age where things that go bump in the night could be a major monster trying to devour the family. \u00a0 However, he states he likes the doll. \u00a0 It has been placed on a shelf overlooking our dinner table. \u00a0 It sits next to Xie&#8217;s Cabbage Kid she bought a few years ago. \u00a0 Who knows maybe the Cabbage Patch Kid will eventually adopt the goth creepy look also.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll end this post with a music video of Jonathan Coulton&#8217;s iconic song, Creepy
