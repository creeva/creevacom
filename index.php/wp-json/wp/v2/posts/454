This is not surprising since he was voted the greatest American that ever lived. Reading through Reagan&#8217;s autobiography I was surprised to see a Romney who was trying to get the republican nomination in 1968. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/George_W._Romney\">George Romney<\/a> (Mitt&#8217;s father) had run and lost the nomination to Richard Nixon.<\/p>\n<p>In full disclosure &#8211; though not the basis of this post &#8211; I&#8217;m a Ron Paul Supporter &#8211; that being said let&#8217;s move on because that&#8217;s not why I&#8217;m writing this piece.<\/p>\n<p>Reagan was heavily distrustful of career politicians. He ran out of urging the people nothing more. When he was first on the republican ticket as a favorite son, then later when he tried to get the nomination he did so at others&#8217; urging. He realized it was the voice of the people who wanted him. He believed that it was the people who chose a man whether they wanted the position or not.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pratt-Romney_family\"><br \/>\nThe Romney family in comparison is a long line of career politicians<\/a>. While we hold families like the Kennedys in high esteem because they are essentially royalty, the American people need to learn that we can not trust elected officials who was never in the trenches with the common man. The silver spoon electorates that have a destiny in public office at birth need to be stopped. We need more common men that have successfully lived the American dream before they can fully understand the needs of the people they govern.<\/p>\n<p>Mitt Romney may not be a bad guy. He may not have bad ideals &#8211; but essentially we are opening the door to his children and grandchildren to enter public office. The American people once stood up and faced against a monarchy, we can not allow these pseudo-monarchies full of lords and barons that essentially own the feudal lands in which they live.<\/p>\n<p>I can say that if Mitt Romney wins the nomination I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s Hillary or Obama that wins the democrat nomination &#8211; I will vote democrat. Living in Ohio I can say my vote counts for something since we are not a hard blue or red state &#8211; we are pinkish though.<\/p>\n<p>We need to follow the ideals of our forefathers and reject these monarchies as they arise. These people are taught early on to say things they want to hear and seem to be good even if they are not. They have learned well from the teachings of Machiavelli. Anyone coming from a long-lined political family should be immediately treated with more scrutiny than the other candidates.<\/p>\n<p>Reagan coerced and persuaded people into office that didn&#8217;t want to be there. He was always extremely suspicious of people that did. We especially don&#8217;t need another president that is trying to finish everything their father failed to do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most of the Republicans on the ticket keep trying to summon the ghost of Ronald Reagan.
