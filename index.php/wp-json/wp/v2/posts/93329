I have also never been fired (though I was downsized once). \u00a0 Those with a passion will always be rewarded.<\/p>\n<p>The only rush to grow up that I did was to move out of my mother&#8217;s house. \u00a0Between my eighteenth birthday and my twenty-second I lived at home a total of four months. \u00a0 That time was not consecutive. \u00a0 I went to college just under two months after\u00a0turning\u00a0eighteen. \u00a0 After my single year I came back home for a week than I moved in with my girlfriend. \u00a0 Two years later I dumped her for a chance to date this other girl and I moved back home. \u00a0 I things ended up well after one or two months and I moved into her house with her parents. \u00a0 I ended getting an apartment with that girl and then married her.<\/p>\n<p>On the surface I did marry young. \u00a0I was twenty-two and she was nineteen. \u00a0We were engaged after four months. \u00a0 We were married just about sixteen months after our first date. \u00a0It wasn&#8217;t because it was a grown up thing to do. \u00a0 It was because I would always have a friend to play with. \u00a0 A girl who liked science fiction and would eventually have her own action figures and video games. \u00a0 It was someone who was like me, but different enough to make it great.<\/p>\n<p>After ten years of marriage we had a son. \u00a0 Now in front of him we have to do &#8220;let&#8217;s pretend we are grown-ups and apply rules that we would have hated ourselves so we don&#8217;t screw him up&#8221; game. \u00a0After he is asleep or out of sight we are the same as we ever were. \u00a0 Still play acting that we are in our early twenties. \u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping we still think we are in our twenties when we are really in our sixties.<\/p>\n<p>When I&#8217;m in my sixties my son will be in his thirties. \u00a0 I&#8217;ll link him back to this story (or shoot him an email with this story if my blog is gone). \u00a0I&#8217;ll ask him if he was in a hurry to grow up. \u00a0If he still plays with toys and calls dibs on any toys he buys for his kids after they outgrow them. \u00a0 \u00a0I&#8217;ll ask if I have taught him to enjoy life and disregard what society thinks is immature. \u00a0I&#8217;ll question if he actually follows it.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not old yet. \u00a0I may never actually become old. \u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping that my son follows the being young forever mentality. \u00a0 I also pray that the lesson and beliefs get passed down to the generations that come after me. \u00a0The less my family grows up, the happier all of us down the line will be. \u00a0 I&#8217;ve watched family members that came before me grow up. \u00a0 They can sit around and drink tea and discuss politics. \u00a0 I&#8217;m hoping to survive to see my great grand-kids and having light saber duels with them.<\/p>\n<p>That is I&#8217;m thirty-six years young. \u00a0 I&#8217;m tying this up wearing a Pac-Man t-shirt and looking at my Star Wars Galaxies avatar as my desktop background. \u00a0 Within arms reach is a gameboy and about five or six toys that are all mine. \u00a0 There is a pile of working computer equipment (since a geek can never truly have enough) sitting at my feet and through out my house. \u00a0 I&#8217;m pretty much that twenty-two year old that my sixteen year old self wanted to be. \u00a0 I&#8217;m frozen there still hunting for action figures. \u00a0 I&#8217;m still playing video games. \u00a0 I&#8217;m still hoping that I&#8217;ll always kick my son&#8217;s butt in Super Mario Bros. \u00a0In the end you can say I&#8217;m happy, I&#8217;m content, and I&#8217;m still hoping that it will always be that way.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today I celebrate my thirty-sixth birthday. \u00a0 I&#8217;m at the crossroads where I&#8217;m supposed to change my verbiage when someone asks how old I am. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m really at the stage of &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93330,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93329"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93329"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93329\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93330"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93329"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93329"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93329"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
