We have seen businesses like this rise and fall. \u00a0We have known people that have lost access to their Facebook accounts from being hacked or just being banned.<\/p>\n<p>In both of those scenarios all the data is lost. \u00a0 Currently those long insightful comments you make on a friend&#8217;s post is not even backed up into your data archive. \u00a0There is no possible way to retrieve that. It still drives me crazy that there are words, pictures, videos that I created that I do not have access to. \u00a0 At a certain point since it isn&#8217;t a concern to anyone else &#8211; you have to have acceptance. \u00a0 I could protest on Facebook, but my number is so low &#8211; that it&#8217;s non-existent. \u00a0It isn&#8217;t a third-party problem since Facebook doesn&#8217;t allow that type of access via it&#8217;s APIs.<\/p>\n<p>So what can we do?<\/p>\n<p>The first part is of course care about your data. \u00a0 What is important to you and what do you want to disappear? \u00a0I used to have a public lifestream on my site. \u00a0It allowed within 15 minutes to see what I was doing anywhere on the web. \u00a0 Whether it was twitter, flickr, or what music I was listening to &#8211; it streamed on my site in real time. \u00a0This was a lifestream.<\/p>\n<p>While this temporal data was neat, it didn&#8217;t allow you to do much with it. \u00a0 There was a time I would take these feeds and put them onto different sites for redundancy. \u00a0 At some point between then and today it became more important to preserve it myself than displaying it for the world. \u00a0 I&#8217;ll let everyone else do the run around to whatever degree they want to know about me. \u00a0As part of this cleanup, there are quite a few less google hits for my name or nickname. \u00a0I did this to make sure I was aware of what everyone is seeing.<\/p>\n<p>I revisit this strategy yearly. \u00a0I get rid of extra tumblr blogs and twitter handles. \u00a0I do Google searches to see what comes up and mostly to track down old accounts I was using. \u00a0There are enough still out there that I can tackle more next year, or possible for online spring cleaning. \u00a0I have so many online accounts it is more about discovery and verifying data.<\/p>\n<p>This year I went spent a few days and whipped my Linkedin profile into shape. \u00a0I also managed to leverage my contacts and get over the magical 500+ connections mark in Linkedin. \u00a0To give a background on that &#8211; Linkedin will list how many connections you have to everyone that views your profile until you reach 500. \u00a0 At that point all they can see is 500+ for the connection number. \u00a0 It was a goal that I wanted to accomplish and I did.<\/p>\n<p>I also went through a branded all my profile avatars and cover photos properly. \u00a0Essentially I was branding myself by being consistent across platforms. \u00a0 This allows me to see where I have updated and I&#8217;ll know by looking at it that the last time it was updated was 2015. \u00a0 I also have separate \u00a0&#8220;branding&#8221; \u00a0for work profiles and personal ones. \u00a0Consistency is key if you want to know when the last time you edited something was.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this all important in Life Caching? \u00a0Learn where your data is and what data is there. \u00a0If you don&#8217;t know the answer to either of those questions, you don&#8217;t control any of your data. \u00a0The second reason is how can you reuse the data you have already created to make your day to day life easier. \u00a0 Once you have control points for your data, you can figure out how to store and repurpose it.<\/p>\n<p>Two examples on this progress through profiles have been relevant to me in the last 72 hours. \u00a0The first was I had to create an updated work biography of major projects I have worked on. \u00a0 It took me only a few minutes since I had them all recorded on my LinkedIn profile that was recently updated. \u00a0 The second instance is Tumblr. \u00a0I was cleaning up extra Tumblr blogs and found one with writing that hadn&#8217;t been saved back to my regular blog. \u00a0This was done four years ago and if I hadn&#8217;t checked it might have been lost for good. \u00a0 Were these posts meaningful or important? \u00a0They were not. \u00a0Still, they are artifact of myself, so they are important to me.<\/p>\n<p>For the last few years I have been using IFTTT. \u00a0This is a service that automates processes across the web. \u00a0Whenever I generate data online &#8211; it puts each data type (Facebook Status, Tweet, Songs Played, etc.) into a separate text file. \u00a0It also marks when it was shared on my Calendar and send a copy to email. \u00a0 My rules list is pushing over 100 entries, so that is a simplified explanation. \u00a0I can go back and data mine all of it.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t like services that I can&#8217;t get all my data out of, so I treat Facebook as a presentation platform. \u00a0The only original content I can&#8217;t get out is my comments &#8211; but we take what we can. \u00a0However, any status updates I post or picture you tag me &#8211; those are all automatically downloaded and logged. \u00a0It makes the best of a bad situation and I still retain most of my data. \u00a0It may only be a couple times a year &#8211; but I still keyword search through all of those files. \u00a0It&#8217;s like email (which I&#8217;m up to 12 years worth saved) you never know when that data will come in handy.<\/p>\n<p>This all leads us to 2015. \u00a0 The buzz of lifestreaming is gone. \u00a0The off-shoot of data portability has lost it&#8217;s gleam. \u00a0Most people are not interested in any of this anymore. \u00a0They trust the few services they use, and don&#8217;t care about their data (at least not directly until it&#8217;s gone). \u00a0While I can find the occasional article on how to do X, Y, or Z &#8211; the movement that included multiple web services and large geek discussion has gone underground.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m alone and maybe you will find some instruction if this interests on how to save some of your data. \u00a0This is why I posted the picture archiving post last week. \u00a0Would more of these types of posts interest you? \u00a0Do you have questions on saving and using your own data? \u00a0What can I do to help? \u00a0 Feel free to leave a comment on here or Facebook if you are interested.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Technology is a wonderful thing. \u00a0 It enables the public to do so much, but at the same time it allows so much to be taken for granted. \u00a0 About seven-eight years ago there was &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94818,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94817"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=94817"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94817\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94818"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=94817"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=94817"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=94817"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
