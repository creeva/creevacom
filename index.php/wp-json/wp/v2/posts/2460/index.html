I&#8217;ve been using <a href=\"http:\/\/adsense.google.com\/\">Adsense<\/a> for about 4 months now and so far the whopping total I have made is $0.11. Now I hope that I don&#8217;t spend all of that in one place. Wait for a second upon reading the terms of the Adsense account it only starts to pay out when you reach for the first $100.00. I guess that this means my great grandkids may be able to buy a candy bar when inflation has caught up to the point of the payout.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Does This Mean I Shouldn&#8217;t Use Click-Through Programs?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t mean that at all. This means you are going to have to tailor your site to give you the greatest likelihood of getting click-through traffic to work for you. At this moment I&#8217;m going to tell you that I don&#8217;t have the answers. This is honesty and hopefully, we are working on this journey together. Over time we are going to investigate on this journeytogetpaid.com how to make the money you so crave to have. Does craving money make you evil? No, though it shouldn&#8217;t be your single goal in life. I never personally thought of Scrooge McDuck as evil, did you?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><em><strong>Why Doesn&#8217;t it Work?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Well, the honest answer is that sometimes you are too smart for your own good. Do you write pieces that bring in people at your same intelligence level? Do you write a lot about technology and innovation? These really are things that work against you, and more than likely you should move to a page impression-based advertising system (I don&#8217;t have one that I can recommend to you yet). The reason that it doesn&#8217;t work is to think about yourself, when was the last time you clicked on an ad and actually purchased something? If you are like me probably never or very very low chance. This means if your readers are as intelligent and interested in things that you write about as you are &#8211; you are gathering people that are less likely to get ads.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>What Can I do Now?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The quick answer is to start a new blog with a new focus or re-purpose your existing blog. Instead of dealing with technology or personal interests, you should pick topics with a more widespread appeal. If it&#8217;s something you can write about coherently it is never a sell-out approach any more than when you do the normal 9-5 job. It is providing a service. If you are uninteresting in topics such as mortgages, pet products, or the average income of a laden swallow in India; you won&#8217;t get a reader base. If you don&#8217;t have a reader base click-through ads still won&#8217;t work for you.<\/p>\n<p>So I would say your best bet is to write on something that can be monetized to a level you feel comfortable with interacting with people. There is a chance you could start a spam blog based on a typo &#8211; but the rewards can be very low. While you&#8217;ll hear Internet legends of the squatter that has made millions of dollars off one typo &#8211; this really isn&#8217;t true. Maybe once upon a time but right now people are fighting over every last penny available online. I think you should maintain and use click-through advertising from whichever company you find is the best fit for you. I can say that it&#8217;s not the magic bullet you are hoping for.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Originally from journeytogetpaid.com I&#8217;m Going to Be Rich&#8230;Not!!
