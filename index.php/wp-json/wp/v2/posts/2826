After installation, I seemed to have an issue with my video not working (ironic that it works for the installation screens). I futzed with it for a while and since have given up on it. I&#8217;m willing to work around issues and change my methodology to do something because I&#8217;m not using it the way it&#8217;s supposed to be used (part of the mantra of everything I do &#8211; My old home network used to have 16 PC&#8217;s on it). I can only go so far in futzing before it&#8217;s more of a nuisance and gets in the way of getting things done.<\/p>\n<p>After following the Kalway steps that should have enabled it to work, I relented and went back to Ubuntu Hardy Heron 64 Bit &#8211; a fresh install (plus the addition of 2 GB of ram) has made it more &#8220;peppy&#8221; than it was before. I guess my next step will be working on getting VMware working so I can get the couple of Windows programs (Finale) that I want to work with running on my laptop. One great thing about a fresh install is that Ubuntu detected my wireless NIC right away &#8211; that took a couple of hours to get working when I first installed Gutsy Gibbon.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.xielanthia.com\">Xie<\/a> had been having issues with Vista and we salvaged her data and loaded Ubuntu on her laptop as well. She remarked to me that it seemed too simple. I explained how complex you need your operating system to appear. We&#8217;ll see how it goes with her, if she likes it, and if she&#8217;ll stick with it. She has become a bit more like me in the belief of the cloud computing dream and as long as the browser functions as well she&#8217;ll learn to work around everything else.<\/p>\n<p>I can say that I did have mixed feeling about migrating to OSX since I wouldn&#8217;t be able to test Gnome Conduit anymore (except the N810 port), which would make it a lot harder for me to work on documentation. Regardless it seems I&#8217;m now a Linux-for-life type of guy, though it&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t have an XP desktop 5 feet away from me, a 2k3 server in a basement, a first gen mac mini in the next room hooked to the TV, and my work assigned Mac Book Air next to this laptop. Maybe since the N810 is Linux based I should have done a BSD on this laptop? I do think I&#8217;m very comfortable switching between OSs and machines.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So last night I did try to turn my laptop into a Hackintosh, and it didn&#8217;t turn out so well.
