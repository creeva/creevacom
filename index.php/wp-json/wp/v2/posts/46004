or the future equivalent.\u00a0\u00a0 This opens up the question, what good is this data to me now?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to find a way (other than WordPress) to throw everything into a single database of some sort and see what type of information I can get out of it about myself.\u00a0\u00a0 My own naivet\u00e9 is that no good software exists for that.\u00a0\u00a0 You can export your Twitter stream and get keyword analysis done after a long drawn-out process of curating down the data, but shouldn&#8217;t this be something that can be done automatically?\u00a0 Facebook, Twitter, Google, and every other company underneath the sun that has access to your personal data has software that can do this.\u00a0 Why?\u00a0 Am I the only one who cares about looking at and analyzing my own data?\u00a0\u00a0 Isn&#8217;t this type of thing going to be the equivalent of going to the psychologist today?\u00a0 You would be able to self-exam yourself by narrowing down queries.<\/p>\n<p>Example Scenario:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Me: &#8220;Database, tell me about when I was three&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Database: &#8220;You have these 15 marked photographs from when you were three.\u00a0 You also have written these 25\u00a0 blog articles that mention age three.\u00a0\u00a0 Here are major life events that occurred to you when you were three.\u00a0 Here are the major world events that happened when you were three.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Me: &#8220;Subtract &#8220;my son&#8221; from the blog articles&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Database:&#8221;13 blog articles left&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This would need some major tagging to cross-reference information to get stuff out.\u00a0\u00a0 I would also like it to have hooks into other databases for simple cross-reference information that would be relational to the data (Wikipedia, IMDB, etc.).\u00a0 I know that even if I had a generic database and fed it a movie I had seen, it wouldn&#8217;t be able to make recommendations without an algorithm that could calculate it. \u00a0 I&#8217;m not worried about recommendations so much at this time as a way to sort. \u00a0 It should however be able to cache data in from other databases, so if I wrote about watching Star Wars &#8211; it could bring up cultural significance and the IMDB stats.\u00a0 This way you could see how a certain book, movie, or song had relevance in changing your path slightly 3, 5, or 20 years down the road.<\/p>\n<p>This database should also be self-growing &#8211; learning without manual input.\u00a0\u00a0 It should be pulling in data from RSS feeds, google searches, your email account, your documents, and anything else you can think of that may have information about you.\u00a0 Your database in the end should know more information about you than you know about yourself.\u00a0 It knows the emails you haven&#8217;t replied to and may know which ones are important.\u00a0\u00a0 At the least, it could tell you how often you talk about &#8220;paranoia&#8221; in your email conversations.<\/p>\n<p>Why can&#8217;t the average person start taking back his own data?\u00a0 Data portability is great.\u00a0\u00a0 The current state of data portability (very limited) doesn&#8217;t offer much you can do with the data.\u00a0\u00a0 It allows you to take it to another service.\u00a0 It allows you to back it up locally.\u00a0\u00a0 Unless you are an ubergeek there isn&#8217;t much you can do with it yourself.\u00a0\u00a0 I&#8217;ll keep watching for this personal databasing software that one day may mythically rise from the sea of internet websites.\u00a0\u00a0 Knowing most people and how much they care about this stuff though &#8211; I won&#8217;t hold my breath.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have been saving my online data pretty much for three years.\u00a0 Most of it is backed up in email via some fashion or another.\u00a0\u00a0 Some of it is stored in my blog.\u00a0 All of &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":102932,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/46004"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=46004"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/46004\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/102932"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=46004"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=46004"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=46004"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
