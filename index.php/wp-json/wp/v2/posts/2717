through it, a new web service launches and we think it&#8217;s the greatest thing since sliced bread.\u00a0\u00a0 We add a few friends convincing them to leave their current platform and migrate over to your new find.\u00a0\u00a0 Time goes by and a few months later you are realizing that you are not really using that web service.\u00a0\u00a0 You don&#8217;t want to abandon your friends, you also don&#8217;t want to log in to give them updates.\u00a0 This is the dilemma that many users online are facing daily.\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t give you a complete answer, but I can explain to you what I do.<\/p>\n<p>One thing I utilize in my social networks is crossposting.\u00a0\u00a0 Utilizing WordPress plugins and general trickery I manage to crosspost to my most used social networks where I may or may not have any friends, but I&#8217;m there so my friends can choose which social network they wish to follow me on instead of what I am using.\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately what I&#8217;ve learned is that I&#8217;m happy to update myself on social networks, but most people I know update slowly and don&#8217;t produce much content for me to read, so I more or less catch up on all of them via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spokeo.com\">Spokeo<\/a>.\u00a0\u00a0 Cross-posting allows me though to update them without me having to manually go update myself on those other networks.\u00a0\u00a0 For all intents and purposes from my point of view if I don&#8217;t log in and interact with that service anymore it&#8217;s abandoned.\u00a0\u00a0 The services I cross-post to are vox, myspace, xanga, live spaces, live journal (which crosspost to dandelife for me), blogger, and multiply.<\/p>\n<p>This however only allows a fraction of the services I used in the past that share my content and link back to my main blog.\u00a0\u00a0 For other services I utilize RSS feed widgets or even automatic updates that occur via the RSS feed.\u00a0\u00a0 The services I use to crosspost my RSS feed items are tumblr, twitter, jaiku, facebook, suprglu, friendfeed, and lijit.\u00a0\u00a0 This allows all my updates to occur over to those sites.<\/p>\n<p>I only interact with a handful of services, luckily services I like flickr, youtube, facebook, and livejournal all import their comments back to my blog.\u00a0\u00a0 All web services I use that allow for an RSS feed I import via email subscriptions through feedburner.\u00a0\u00a0 This allows me to life cache.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a service that you don&#8217;t use anymore discover some way to import your updated content into it.\u00a0\u00a0 A little bit of effort that is automatic in the future goes a long way to maintaining those friendships you have on your social networks.\u00a0\u00a0 It also stops your friends from getting upset with you for abandoning them (they&#8217;ll never know the difference).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all go through it, a new web service launches
