For those uninitiated, a Maid-Rite is a loose meat sandwich that is best described as a sloppy joe without the sauce. It&#8217;s a big deal in Greenville and one of those locals flavors that only exist trapped in time.<\/p>\n<p>My parents grew up in Greenville and every year we would go down and visit my grandparents, swim at the pool which Grandpa managed (for me it was the new pool &#8211; though I always hear how great the old pool was), and eat at Maid-Rites. What started as a traditional turned into a craving. It was something that every once in a while you must have. You will go to satisfy the urge even if the drive is 3 hours each way.<\/p>\n<p>While we were sitting in the restaurant I realized that eating there with my son that at least four, possibly five, generations have eaten there. Since it is a very tiny restaurant we probably all sat in the same spots. I know for fact that my grandparents, my father, my son, and myself have eaten there. I&#8217;m assuming that at some point my great-grandfather came to visit the family from Grove City and had one also. As much as the restaurant is a city tradition, for some it becomes a family one.<\/p>\n<p>There is one cardinal rule to eating at Maid-Rites &#8211; no Ketchup. While we are at it there are no fries either. The standard sandwich comes with mustard, pickles, and minced onions. You can also order one with cheese. I&#8217;ve always had pop with mine, but my wife and son tried a milkshake on the recommendation of my godmother. Their shakes are some of the best I have ever had. However, I&#8217;m still going to drink pop with my sandwich.<\/p>\n<p>There is one other part to this restaurant&#8217;s tradition. The gum wall.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-08-18.00.18-1-1.jpg\" class=\"broken_link\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-93815\" alt=\"2013-09-08 18.00.18\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-08-18.00.18-1-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-08-18.00.18-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-08-18.00.18-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-08-18.00.18-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-08-18.00.18-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/2013-09-08-18.00.18-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yes, that is a picture of years and years of gum stuck upon the wall. Some of the pieces I stuck on there as a child might even still be there. It&#8217;s crazy. I&#8217;m sure when the gum wall started that it drove the owner&#8217;s nuts. They now however embrace it. It is one of the unique things that has made them famous.<\/p>\n<p>There are two Maid-Rite recipes I can find, depending on the ingredients you have on hand is which one you choose to make. This first recipe is the only one I have cooked at home &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.greenwave1974.com\/maidrites.htm\" class=\"broken_link\">I found it on the Greenwave1974.com<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>2 pounds of ground beef<br \/>\n1 cup beer<br \/>\n1 1\/2 tsp. white pepper<br \/>\n2 tsp. dry mustard<br \/>\n2 tbsp. sugar<\/p>\n<p>Boil (<i>yes, boil<\/i>) the beef in a pot with enough water to just cover the meat. Boil until the pink is gone, then drain.<\/p>\n<p>Put drained beef in a large skillet and add all remaining ingredients. Simmer and stir, continually breaking up the beef until crumbly and the beer is almost evaporated.<\/p>\n<p>Serve on steamed buns, topping with cheese, diced onion, mustard and dill pickles to taste.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When I made it I did not steam the buns, but they were still great. This next recipe I have not tried yet, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cooks.com\/recipe\/vw8eq7eq\/original-maid-rites.html\">it was from cooks.com<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>1 1\/2 lb. hamburger<br \/>\n1 med. onion, minced<br \/>\n1 tbsp. prepared mustard<br \/>\n1\/2 c. water<br \/>\n1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce<br \/>\n1\/4 tsp. salt or to taste<br \/>\nSimmer hamburger and onion. Do not brown. Add other ingredients and<br \/>\nsimmer. Serve on buns with mustard, if desired<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In Iowa there is a major chain of Maid-Rite restaurants that started in the 1920&#8217;s with a similar flavor and style sandwich. The Greenville store has existed since 1934. Obviously at one point there was a franchise deal, but that seems to have dissolved decades ago. The only restaurant the corporate chain has in Ohio is located in Piqua, about twenty miles away from Greenville. I&#8217;m guessing corporate attempted to cash in to the Greenville stores popularity &#8211; but it can&#8217;t touch it from what I&#8217;m told.<\/p>\n<p>My hometown of Vermilion, OH didn&#8217;t have any place that was similar. It has its own unique restaurants &#8211; but none that have the local appeal as this one did. The closest we could claim was Dairy Dock. Amherst, OH about fifteen miles away does have a similar experience store called Hot Dog Heaven. Being right down the road from the local high school it is regularly packed every day of the week. It&#8217;s another small restaurant with rabid fans. I sometimes get similar cravings for Hot Dog Heaven &#8211; my other Grandparents live in Amherst &#8211; so I had about equal exposure as I did to Maid-Rites.<\/p>\n<p>Home towns with unique flavors are always fascinating to me. The town I live in now doesn&#8217;t have anything that comes close. There is a frequented hot dog stand everyone visits. It doesn&#8217;t however have anything on Hot Dog Heaven. We also have nothing that comes close to a Maid-Rite. If you ever have a chance to eat there, I highly recommend it. There are few places that you can say that at least five generations of family has dined at over a fifty year span.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This last weekend we made the trip Greenville, OH to visit &#8211; but more importantly to get a Maid-Rite.
