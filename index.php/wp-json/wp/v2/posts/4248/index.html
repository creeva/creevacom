Back before I started a blog, I was just a person on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.starwarsgalaxies.com\">swg<\/a> forum with the name <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\">Creeva<\/a> in his signature. I did a random <a href=\"http:\/\/google.com\">Google<\/a> search and I had less then 100 entries, about 3 years ago I was still stuck at 419 entries. These days <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?hl=en&amp;q=creeva&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=\">my number fluctuates for 20k-60K entries in Google<\/a> depending on the day. I&#8217;m still proud of having the number one entry in Google for &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/01\/24\/google-almost-completely-agrees-with-my-choice-of-mankinds-greatest-accomplishment\/\" class=\"broken_link\">the greatest accomplishment of mankind<\/a>&#8221; and not so happy about being number one for &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?hl=en&amp;q=afk+entertainer&amp;btnG=Search\">afk entertainer<\/a>&#8221; (UPDATE ON THE SECOND ONE &#8211; I&#8217;ve been bumped to number 2 &#8211; yay me). One thing always bothered me when I started this trip of seeding Google, the fact that originally when I searched for &#8220;Creeva&#8221; that Google sent me back the suggestion &#8220;Did you mean <em>Creeval<\/em>?&#8221; &#8211; this continued on when I had more hits for Creeva in the database then existed for Creeval.<\/p>\n<p>Every few months I did a variation search on Creeva and normally I would either get no suggestion for some spellings, or I would get something spelled different. Today however when I did a search for &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?hl=en&amp;q=Creeeva&amp;btnG=Search\">Creeeva<\/a>&#8221; it came back with the suggestion &#8220;did you mean <em>Creeva<\/em>?&#8221;. Finally I&#8217;ve broken through the glass ceiling of valid search terms and &#8220;Creeva&#8221; will start being a valid suggestion.<\/p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t care if this changes tomorrow and it goes back to some other suggestion, today I have my moment in the sun.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/farm4.static.flickr.com\/3354\/3273878785_f1ee51770f_o.png\" class=\"broken_link\">See the full size picture of Google&#8217;s suggestion here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Granted as a side note, my real name has only 4900 hits for it, and when I search on it, it suggest a different spelling of the last name (different person). The suggestion also has 1500 less hits for his name then I have for mine, but that&#8217;s a battle for another day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What a long strange trip it&#8217;s been.
