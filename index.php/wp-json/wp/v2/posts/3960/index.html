This however is not syncing, it&#8217;s distribution and publishing. A true sync across all platforms would be amazing.<\/p>\n<p>The example I would love is I make an edit to a blog post, then every place and profile that I&#8217;ve published that post on would update with no manual intervention. Since I can&#8217;t do that, <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\">localhost\/wordpress<\/a> is considered my authoritative location for all blog posts. If I wanted to edit those other sites I would have to do each one manually. Granted I&#8217;m sure without using syncing it saves on bandwidth.<\/p>\n<p>Things that I can sync? Well my contacts and calendars with Plaxo, but that kind of is just the tip of the iceberg. My biggest issue right now is syncing <a href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\">Flickr<\/a> photos to <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\">Facebook<\/a>. I am aware of Flickurbook, but this still uses your local machine &#8211; there is no reason this can&#8217;t be done &#8220;in the cloud&#8221;. It&#8217;s all soooo sloooooow. Seriously at the speed it moves, I could just reupload all the pictures to Facebook faster than this thing goes. It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s the developer&#8217;s fault, and it&#8217;s great what he did, but it&#8217;s not the solution I&#8217;m looking for.<\/p>\n<p>Finally using my distribution chain I chase all over the web to answer comments. I don&#8217;t mind doing that. However, wouldn&#8217;t it be better if, across all platforms and services, these comments were kept in sync? Then I could use the spam filters I wanted to from a central location. I could reply to comments from a central location.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m just pipe dreaming again&#8230;..<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from here I&#8217;m the crossposting whore &#8211; I write once and I have everything designed to publish everywhere (well at least when things aren&#8217;t broken like Ping.fm to Myspace blogs).
