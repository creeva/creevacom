In my family however it&#8217;s an Olympic event. I&#8217;m not sure my mother would get the gold, but I&#8217;m sure she would at least get the silver.<\/p>\n<p>When you live in a split family you get used to what you can tell one side or tell the other. The hard part however is not admitting you talked to the other side at all. Once my mother finds out she grilled me on what my father had to say, though I never really passed the information along that he gave me. In the reverse I never passed it along the other way either. I was not the hub of their game of telephone, nor was I going to start to be.<\/p>\n<p>The whole issue that led up to us not speaking she still blames on my father. She thinks my father sent me on some fools errand that was not accurate. Ironically what my father told me was accurate by my mother&#8217;s own admittal. My father however didn&#8217;t prompt me to take action, what I wanted ot do to help my sister was for myself alone. It was me being a big brother.<\/p>\n<p>The irony of this it seems what I hear through the family grapevine that my father seems to get more blame for me not talking to my mother then I do. Who would have thought. I obviously must be a puppet that can be controlled, that has no independent thought or feelings. I know some people are like that, not me though.<\/p>\n<p>The whole problem is that it&#8217;s not just my mother. Like I said talking behind the back is an Olympic sport in these parts. Whenever I try to lay out what everyone is saying to everyone else, I&#8217;m the bad guy. I&#8217;m the bad guy because I lay it out on the line.<\/p>\n<p>Well I guess this is why I&#8217;m blogging about it, I&#8217;m laying it out on the line.<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 2 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 3 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 4 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 5 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 6 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 7 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 8 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 9 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 10 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 11 here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 12 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For some reason it&#8217;s a considered a cardinal sin in society to talk about people behind their backs.
