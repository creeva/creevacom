I enjoyed Palm OS, but even I&#8217;ve moved on. I have to write my history with Palm hardware article soon. I paired the TX with my N810, and after verifying I could still get online with it through my phone. The TX&#8221;s web browser is weak compared to the N810&#8217;s and other than a syncing contact manager (something the N810 is lacking at) I have no real use for the TX anymore.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I was thinking about what I can do with it. I may have sold my wife&#8217;s but I&#8217;m not sure I want to give mine up yet &#8211; so functional decisions. I can make it a high-end universal remote &#8211; maybe a TV-be-gone device. What I decided it turns out I can&#8217;t do &#8211; is make it a Bluetooth file server. Here is what I figured, my N810 only has a MicroSD card slot, so it can&#8217;t read normal SD cards &#8211; if I needed the extra space I could pop an SD card into the TX, power it on, and access it via Bluetooth on the N810.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Unfortunately (like always) the manufacturer cheaped out on the specs. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any way to share files over Bluetooth on the TX. I can access files on my phone from N810, but nothing on the TX. So I&#8217;m throwing this out there to the world at large, does anyone know of a way to put a bluetooth file server (for free preferably) on a Palm TX (or Treo, or Lifedrive, or any Bluetooth enabled Palm)? If so please leave a comment and a link. You can also leave a comment if you think I&#8217;m insane also.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So this week I charged up my old Palm TX, I&#8217;ve been mourning over the death of Palm OS.
