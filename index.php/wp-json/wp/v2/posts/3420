Users logged into the CRM would associate their own &#8211; or a corporation profile with Linkedin<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 User plugins in the new contacts e-mail address<\/p>\n<p>3. User is prompted with &#8220;Would You Like to Request Connection on Linkedin?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0 If the user states yes the plugin would go into a state of &#8220;Waiting for Remote User to Confirm&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>5.\u00a0 At this point the user could add in all the information they normally would in the CRM database<\/p>\n<p>6.\u00a0 Later the user would receive a confirmation (or decline) of linking up on LinkedIn<\/p>\n<p>7. If they receive a confirmation they could then pull in the information to the CRM application.<\/p>\n<p>8.\u00a0 Then the CRM application would have connections and how they relate to each other in their database, home pages, Resumes, etc. &#8211; all from a couple of clicks.<\/p>\n<p>That is a scenario that would appeal to sales personnel.\u00a0\u00a0 Let&#8217;s look at something more urbane, a library look-up system. A library lookup system is something very simple and single task.\u00a0 It works well and returns (normally) the following information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Title<\/li>\n<li>Author<\/li>\n<li>Subject<\/li>\n<li>Location<\/li>\n<li>If it&#8217;s in or checked out<\/li>\n<li>Sometimes a Summary<\/li>\n<li>Sometimes an Image<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s look at methods we can use to extend this functionality.\u00a0 The first thing I would make sure of is there is a public internet-accessible site that either the general public or the Library chooses just card members can access.\u00a0 Library users are normally people that live in the same town and there are a good number of them that know each other.\u00a0 What does that buy you?\u00a0 Word of mouth.\u00a0 What about a secondary revenue stream outside of donations or overdue fines?\u00a0 How can you leverage more people to show up at your fundraising drives?\u00a0 I&#8217;m assuming these are questions that library officials ask themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 How can we turn that simple search to find a book into something more?<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s give the users an option to use the search page as a social platform.\u00a0 I would give the users a choice of using the old style simple search functions, but also give them a chance to leverage the public you are serving to work with you instead of you working for them.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go over an imaginary social library platform.<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0 User opens up a search window in the library database and enters a query.<\/p>\n<p>2. User gets back the title, author, and subject &#8211; then a link that states more information (this is where a plugin would take over)<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0 On the plugin page users could get back an image of what they are searching for.\u00a0 They also see where it is located, if it&#8217;s in or not, and more.\u00a0\u00a0 What about a sidebar that allows them to purchase the book\/movie\/CD at <a href=\"http:\/\/amazon.com\">Amazon<\/a>?\u00a0 Reviews from other library patrons?\u00a0 A list of who checked out which book (make this opt-in only on a per-title usage &#8211; don&#8217;t compromise a user&#8217;s privacy).\u00a0 A listing of library events where the author is signing books, giving a reading, or there is a book discussion covering these topics?<\/p>\n<p>You just made something that is infinitely more &#8220;sticky&#8221; and lets the users interact with your site on a much larger scale than previously.\u00a0 They are no longer browsing alone, but in a group, with people they know from town.<\/p>\n<p>All of this is possible with a platform that allows plugins.\u00a0 I&#8217;m not asking for web application developers to support any plugins directly.\u00a0 If a plugin breaks or crashes the core site (shame on the user that puts an untested plugin in a production environment) &#8211; the web application developer should tell the user they will not support the product with any plugins running at all.\u00a0\u00a0 It doesn&#8217;t mean the framework, APIs, and access shouldn&#8217;t be there.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pleading with web application developers that allow the users to have self-hosted servers to please build this extensibility into their products.\u00a0\u00a0 I can hack around another platform and get these functions, but sometimes we just want to buy a program from a vendor with support.\u00a0\u00a0 Currently, you are making us choose between function or support.\u00a0\u00a0 It should not be that way.\u00a0 Opening up can only gain customer loyalty in the long run.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here Just the other day I wrote about cloud computing versus SaS terminology.\u00a0\u00a0 A web application isn&#8217;t necessarily a cloud computing or SaS platform.\u00a0\u00a0 It can be one or the other, it can &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":97597,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3420"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3420"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3420\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/97597"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3420"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3420"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3420"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
