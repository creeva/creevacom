these are pushed the back of the bus at the very bottom of the post. \u00a0 This is encouragement to keep the post short, just so they can get to the image or video.<\/p>\n<p>There is the option to write a piece somewhere else and share the link. \u00a0Then you can a preface to the most encouraging your friends to click the link and read your words. \u00a0 I can say from looking at web statistics that my friends don&#8217;t read the posts I put on my blog. \u00a0 The majority of my web traffic comes from google searches. \u00a0This is fine for me, but it shows the lack of effort that people put into something as simple as a click that isn&#8217;t a cute image or a viral video.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you are using Facebook to deliver your message, you also can&#8217;t really use different fonts or styles &#8211; you are told how you must be dressed to appear in public. \u00a0There are no tattoos or loud music &#8211; no shirt and no service &#8211; these are Facebook&#8217;s rules. \u00a0 While our messages must be different and we have the illusion of cover images and profile pictures &#8211; we must all be the same. \u00a0 The only thing that makes each of us different is the message, not the window dressings.<\/p>\n<p>The reason that Facebook enforces such structured and conformist designs is so they don&#8217;t fall into the problem of <a href=\"http:\/\/myspace.com\">MySpace<\/a>. \u00a0 With MySpace the network was originally setup for bands to share to music. \u00a0 This lead to pages with autoplaying music, videos, and garish designs that could hurt even the youngest person with the worst taste. \u00a0People moved to the quieter interface of Facebook and that&#8217;s where we are today.<\/p>\n<p>I think there is beauty in simplicity, but at the same time my design beliefs shouldn&#8217;t be shoved down everyone else&#8217;s throat. \u00a0 If you want to change your profile coloring from Facebook Blue\/White\/Black color scheme to Lime Green\/Hot Pink\/Hazel on your profile page, I think you should be able to do it. \u00a0 However I should have the option to override the styles with my own when I view it. \u00a0 I should also be able to have the option to see what you think is the perfect design. \u00a0 This kind of customization should be simple and we could keep the Newsfeed to the Facebook standard.<\/p>\n<p>Things get even worse once we get outside of the customization and limitations of profile pages let&#8217;s look at a couple other Facebook features. \u00a0 Photo sharing is probably the most common thing you see on Facebook. \u00a0 You have shares from the web where you put in the URL, you have shares that other people have uploaded and you share with your friends, and you have images you upload to your albums. \u00a0 The first two are fine since effectively you are resharing someone else&#8217;s work. \u00a0The last however get&#8217;s tricky.<\/p>\n<p>If you comment on a picture that you shared three years ago it pops up in the Newsfeed as something you just uploaded. \u00a0It&#8217;s the new hot topic, even if it is really old news. \u00a0 So many times in the last few months I track down a photo to tag someone via a comment just to make it easier for them to see what you&#8217;re talking about. \u00a0 This leads into more likes on the photo and added commentary. \u00a0Depending on the intent and the image this can be both good or bad. \u00a0 However, you can&#8217;t control it and Facebook has decided how this interaction is going to take place.<\/p>\n<p>Some people also use Facebook to back up images. \u00a0 This is a terrible idea, but people just don&#8217;t know any better. \u00a0 The major issue for me is Facebook resizing the image. \u00a0 Since it is resized you have lost your original, you are now stuck with something lower quality to stick with for all time. \u00a0 For many people this is no big deal &#8211; until you lose the first images of your child that you had high-resolution images of. \u00a0Personally I use Flickr, then I mirror them over to Google. \u00a0 I also have a local copy. \u00a0 My world would have to implode before I lost all copies of my images (around twenty thousand separate files).<\/p>\n<p>Finally the last thing most people use Facebook for is invitations. \u00a0 For ease of use it can&#8217;t be beat for most people. \u00a0 If you are a power user, the options can be seen as lacking. \u00a0 There are so many better scheduling options out there &#8211; the disadvantage of course is audience. \u00a0 If almost all the people you want to invite are on Facebook (and they are) then it makes sense to use it for invitations and calendaring. \u00a0 We don&#8217;t even need to remember birthdays anymore, Facebook will remind us. \u00a0For the majority of Americans they don&#8217;t even keep a calendar &#8211; they have Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>This post however is not about attacking Facebook. \u00a0 You could substitute any social network with what I&#8217;ve been talking about. \u00a0 The problem is the inertia that Facebook has that the discussion for other networks is not as obvious to most people who don&#8217;t use them. \u00a0 Facebook is the juggernaut and people like that. \u00a0 It&#8217;s like television before cable came out. \u00a0 You have three or four choices for how you want to receive information and that is it.<\/p>\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>People don&#8217;t like choice. \u00a0 If you give someone too many options they go with what seems the easiest and what everyone else is doing. \u00a0When you get to something the size of Facebook you have to make concessions on what you choose. \u00a0You have to give either keep you message short or trust that people are going to click the link. \u00a0 You have to use a third-party service or worry that if you write something in long form to share publicly that you are very conscious that you are not making everything public.<\/p>\n<p>You are praying that instead of comments and social interaction that used to exist on the web that you get someone to click the like button. \u00a0 Instead of interaction the like button has become what we value our content on. \u00a0 A reshare of our content, what that&#8217;s the holy grail and most of us don&#8217;t believe it really exists for small bloggers like myself.<\/p>\n<p>We could have changed this world. \u00a0We could have all been different and still interacted with one another. \u00a0 When I saw the force that Facebook would become I didn&#8217;t like it. \u00a0 I came up with another web service. \u00a0 The idea behind it was primarily about choice. \u00a0 This was my naivet\u00e9. \u00a0I didn&#8217;t take account that while people love novelty, they don&#8217;t like to have too many choices.<\/p>\n<p>My vision was a new web service that would connect with all the other web services. \u00a0The closest thing that exists today is <a href=\"http:\/\/ifttt.com\">IFTTT<\/a> (which I highly recommend play with if you like choice without having to babysit it). \u00a0The problem with IFTTT is they are a back-end service. \u00a0They will move content and post it to other services &#8211; but there isn&#8217;t much interaction you can do on the site itself.<\/p>\n<p>Ideally my service would have had a front-end, a back-end, and an API. \u00a0 I worked this out with some other people (and our visions were all slightly different &#8211; this one is just mine). \u00a0 The back-end would work like IFTTT, but with some slight functionality differences. \u00a0 It&#8217;s similar enough that I can use it for the example. \u00a0 The front-end would aggregate your friend&#8217;s content from different services (such as Flickr, Your Blog, Facebook, Foursquare, etc.). \u00a0This would act similar to the Newsfeed in Facebook. \u00a0 You could interact with all the other sites commenting, liking, retweeting, and sharing information in-between them from a single interface. \u00a0 The API would allow others to build upon this aggregation with different Web Apps, Mobile Apps, and Desktop Apps. \u00a0 This would have allowed choice to flourish.<\/p>\n<p>The stopping issue though was a couple of things. \u00a0The first being that the idea people behind it (myself included) understand web and data, but we aren&#8217;t programmers. \u00a0 We could not do it ourselves. \u00a0 We also didn&#8217;t have the capital to hire someone to start programming it. \u00a0 I setup the business case and tried to go to a couple of investors, but nothing panned out. \u00a0 The vision was dead. \u00a0 I had even factored in how to actually turn a profit with the company unlike Facebook or Twitter when they started. \u00a0I had even designed a way for users to get paid on their own content, something Facebook will never give to you.<\/p>\n<p>The reason I wanted the service is that from my blog I was crossposting content to other services. \u00a0 Unfortunately dealing with commenting was tiresome across different services. \u00a0 Since that time I have streamlined my web operation, but to do that I had to leave part of an audience. \u00a0 That audience may have been small and spread out, but there are still eyeballs out there I left and didn&#8217;t reach. \u00a0 I chose the optimal strategy for myself and went with it. \u00a0 I now have something that I find quite manageable and routine.<\/p>\n<p>The bulk of the population just uses Facebook. \u00a0 It&#8217;s easy. It&#8217;s simple. \u00a0It&#8217;s good enough. \u00a0 That kind of where Facebook and really any industry with a 90% market share get&#8217;s us &#8211; good enough. \u00a0 You can&#8217;t pull people away from the gravity of force that is Facebook. \u00a0 \u00a0For Facebook to go down it will take one of the largest corporate missteps the world has ever seen. \u00a0 An outside competitor will not dethrone Facebook, only Facebook can dethrone itself.<\/p>\n<p>Since people won&#8217;t leave Facebook the social network competitors and third-party web app companies have become stagnant. \u00a0Back in the 2005-2009 timeframe I was looking at new web companies every week. \u00a0 Now it is down to a trickle &#8211; and some of those you can only access through a single app. \u00a0 Once again your choice of how you want your data presented is singular and non-customizable.<\/p>\n<p>Choice is important, but because of the audience and interaction on Facebook has\u00a0taken away there is very little choice left. \u00a0 It is the largest all-encompassing social network. \u00a0 Twitter is the juggernaut of simple status messages. \u00a0 Flickr the former photo-sharing juggernaut is behind Imgur and Facebook. \u00a0We gave up the best of breeds for good enough, because using too many things are too complicated &#8211; even though a web service such as my own could have made all of that abstract.<\/p>\n<p>Where do we go from here? \u00a0Do we keep marching along drone like without expanding? Are the voices we fling out in the web destined to die because people refuse to click a simple link because it&#8217;s too much effort? \u00a0 Do we suffer from the lack of users commenting and hope for someone to click the like button? \u00a0 I don&#8217;t know. \u00a0 I can only sit back and watch and think what might have been.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; About six or seven years ago I saw the writing on the wall. \u00a0 Facebook was going to become the dominant social network. \u00a0This had its benefits such as a singular point to &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93900,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93897"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93897"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93897\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93900"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93897"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93897"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93897"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
