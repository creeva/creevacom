that and it was only one dollar per person to get in.\u00a0 However, it was a Sunday, you would have thought they would have had everything setup the day before.\u00a0\u00a0 Must be something in the Ohio water that breeds laziness.\u00a0\u00a0 We did manage to eat some fair food, look at all of the animals, vegetables, and crafts.\u00a0 I can say I have a different eye when looking at photography now, though it&#8217;s not the same eye as Xie &#8211; other wise we would have to trade through out the today to get anything done.\u00a0\u00a0 We also managed to get to see another community band (I missed which one), and listened to some one else play some of the songs that I play with my band.<\/p>\n<p>Next on the agenda is next Thursday, I&#8217;ll be playing at the Lorain County Fair with the <a href=\"http:\/\/vcma.net\">VCMA<\/a>.\u00a0 This will be my first trip back to the Lorain County Fair in at least eight years (maybe longer).\u00a0\u00a0 There is a chance I&#8217;ll run into my kindergarten teacher, my family always ran into her we went growing up.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes she should know who I am, she only taught for one year.\u00a0 It should at least be interesting and I have free tickets.<\/p>\n<p>On September 16th I&#8217;ll be playing with the Ashland Community Band at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ashlandcountyfair.com\/ \">Ashland County Fair<\/a>.\u00a0\u00a0 Now I can say that the last time I visited the Ashland County Fair was when I was in college, so that was back in 1994.\u00a0 It&#8217;s been 14 years since I&#8217;ve been to this fair, and the first time I&#8217;ll be playing with this group in this type of venue.\u00a0\u00a0 It should be interesting to say the least.\u00a0\u00a0 Band practices start on September 2nd, so we&#8217;ll have a whopping two rehearsals before the fair.\u00a0\u00a0 We&#8217;ll see how it goes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here Traditionally (since I&#8217;ve been with Xie) we don&#8217;t normally go to county fairs.\u00a0\u00a0 Of course there have been brief dabbles, a single visit or so to the Lorain County Fair or visits &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3077"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3077"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3077\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3077"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3077"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3077"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
