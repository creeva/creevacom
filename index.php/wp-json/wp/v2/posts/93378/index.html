If you didn&#8217;t get your chance to ride them yet, you will never have another.<\/p>\n<p>I can say that few people are speaking for the Space Spiral. It was a ride that you took when you had a chance, but very few of us held it as I must ride it now ride. Both of the rides are older and I&#8217;m sure the maintenance costs are not worth it for rides that in themselves bring few people to the park. That doesn&#8217;t mean that we all don&#8217;t have fond memories of them. In my mind both rides will remain one of the parts of growing up and living at Cedar Point.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mycpguide.com\/park\/rides\/tranquil\/spacespiral\/\">from MyCPGuide<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Space Spiral point of view video:<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center><center><\/center>Disaster Transport commercial:<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Space Spiral and Disaster Transport &#8211; RIP 2012.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from Wikipedia I previously wrote my pieces on Disaster Transport and the Space Spiral.
