Please read those articles if you want a little more perspective on my feelings. Since today is the last day the rides are operational, I thought I would give them one last farewell into the night. If you didn&#8217;t get your chance to ride them yet, you will never have another.<\/p>\n<p>I can say that few people are speaking for the Space Spiral. It was a ride that you took when you had a chance, but very few of us held it as I must ride it now ride. Both of the rides are older and I&#8217;m sure the maintenance costs are not worth it for rides that in themselves bring few people to the park. That doesn&#8217;t mean that we all don&#8217;t have fond memories of them. In my mind, both rides will remain one of the parts of growing up and living at Cedar Point.<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center><center><\/center><center><\/center>Space Spiral and Disaster Transport &#8211; RIP 2012.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I previously wrote my pieces on Disaster Transport and the Space Spiral.
