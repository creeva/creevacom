She dropped me off at burger king to eat and went over to my mothers to talk (this is all second hand mind compared to most things I&#8217;ve written). Xie sat her down and told her she was going to push her children away one by one if she continued down the path she was going. That my mother had to pick herself up, get a job and move forward being an example (I&#8217;m sure Xie will comment on this story to fill in more details). <\/p>\n<p>The selfish thing my mom said to my wife? &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to have a job why should I?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Now because this is second hand I normally wouldn&#8217;t have included this, but I wanted to point out Xie&#8217;s effort. This wasn&#8217;t the first time my mother had said this. There are a lot of answers to this.<\/p>\n<p>1. Xie has a supportive husband that hadn&#8217;t left her once and possibly will again<br \/>\n2. Xie spends her free time learning and expanding herself &#8211; my mothers expansion comes from Oprah and Dr. Phil<br \/>\n3. Xie doesn&#8217;t have two children at home not even teenagers yet that need to eat and hopes daddy will give mommy child support money<br \/>\n4. Xie isn&#8217;t a leech that feels entitled to it, she has offered to work many times, I don&#8217;t understand why both of us need to be miserable for a few extra bucks<\/p>\n<p>While my mother is grazing the home shopping network for things to buy, Xie is doing Algebra out of text books for fun. There is a world of difference. Most notably my mother needed an income she could trust to take care of her kids and not ask friends and family for money to get by. <\/p>\n<p>I will now give you an example I have full memory and first hand knowledge of. It was at a family holiday dinner a few years ago at my grandparents and somehow the morbid subject of what we would like if my grandparents passed on. I stated I would only want one thing, a cedar chest crafted by my grandmother&#8217;s cousin. My grandmother chimed in that it was going to be given to her cousins family, well my grandmother has been saying that my whole life, so for thirty years it&#8217;s still been sitting there. My mother then said I couldn&#8217;t have it because she wanted it. Selfish? Well let&#8217;s continue this story. <\/p>\n<p>A few minutes later my mother asked me why I wanted the chest because she thought it was ugly and tacky. I said it was something that would always remind me of my grandparents, their house, and the memories. To me the chest is kind of like a symbol of my grandparents. This prompted me though to ask why did she want it if it was ugly? Her answer? She said she wanted it because I said I wanted it. So I was shocked and called her selfish, I think that was my annual fight that year and I left. It was petty, you would think as adamant as she was when she said she wanted it, that somehow I knew there was a secret stash of money tucked away in it. Nope, she is just worried about someone else getting something she can&#8217;t. What a great mother. <\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 2 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 3 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 4 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 5 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 6 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 7 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 8 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 9 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 10 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 11 here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 12 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 13 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 14 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At one point in this whole debacle where I stopped talking to my mom, Xie thought she would try to mend things.
