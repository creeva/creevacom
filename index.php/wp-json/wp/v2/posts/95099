It was the day Star Trek the Next Generation premiered and I was eleven years old. \u00a0I had grown up a child of the sit in front of the TV all day generation. One of these rituals on the weekend was watching Star Trek on channel 43 WUAB. \u00a0 I was a big fan and watched the marathons when they happened. \u00a0 It was a deep fascination of science fiction that started in early life. \u00a0 Granted I was born to be a Star Wars fan &#8211; but in the 80s we prayed for the once a year showing of a New Hope. \u00a0 Even then I normally had to go to bed before getting to watch the whole thing.<\/p>\n<p>My parents disliked science fiction. \u00a0 That&#8217;s a little bit unfair, my mother disliked science fiction. \u00a0I only know of one science fiction movie she liked, The Last Starfighter. \u00a0 She took me to see that in the theater three times. \u00a0My father had a disinterest in science fiction. \u00a0 I, however, couldn&#8217;t get enough. \u00a0I would watch any and all science fiction I would have a chance to. \u00a0 I guess with being hand carried to the A New Hope, begging my grandmother to take me to see Flash Gordon at 4, and seeing countless other movies at the theater &#8211; my family did indulge me in what I want to watch. \u00a0 I&#8217;m sure Gee (my mom&#8217;s mom) was very confused sitting through Transformers the Movie at Midway Mall Theater, but they indulged me and I love them for it. \u00a0However they didn&#8217;t understand.<\/p>\n<p>I was 10 years old when Star Trek: TNG was announced. \u00a0I was bouncing off the walls. \u00a0 Through syndication I had already seen just about all the episodes of the original series multiple times. \u00a0 This was new science fiction, something that happened very rarely on television. \u00a0My parents however, were very ho-hum. \u00a0 I was lucky though. \u00a0 When I was living in the condominium in Elyria I had a best friend next door, Eric Mitchell. \u00a0There was literally only a wall between us since our bedrooms shared a wall in our condo units. \u00a0 I&#8217;ll save stories about Eric for another time, but in this instance it is important.<\/p>\n<p>Eric&#8217;s family also loved science fiction. \u00a0 They were excited about the new series. \u00a0Eric had also grown up science fiction and was excited for the show. \u00a0We were all pumped ad when i went over there we would occasionally talked about what it would be like. \u00a0 The premiere dawned closer, and my family had a single TV. \u00a0 While syndication shows aired during the weekend afternoons, \u00a0this new Star Trek was going to air in prime time. \u00a0This was a problem. \u00a0 Sometimes I could have control of the what show we watched in the evenings, but that was a rarity. \u00a0 My parents wouldn&#8217;t likely give up their TV so I could watch it. \u00a0 This however changed because I was invited next door for a premiere party. \u00a0 Party is a loose term, since it was Eric, his parents and myself.<\/p>\n<p>The evening started with playing Atari 2600 on the TV. \u00a0 We then progressed to dinner. \u00a0I believe we had pizza from Danny Boy&#8217;s, but that part I&#8217;m not sure about. \u00a0 Then for some reason at that time one of the major networks showed The Muppet Show at 7:30PM &#8211; so being an 11 and 10 year-old, we watched the Muppets. \u00a0 Eric&#8217;s mother made a giant load of popcorn for all of us to share. \u00a0The glorious moment, occurred the strains of the theme song aired. \u00a0We were all mesmerized by the new science fiction playing before our eyes. \u00a0 It was fantastic.<\/p>\n<p>I remember Eric&#8217;s step-father pointing out McCoy walking the ship. \u00a0Since they didn&#8217;t call his character by name, I never would have recognized him. \u00a0We went through all the callbacks and admired the new characters. Originally we planned to do this weekly, but life happens. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t know how often I watched the show over there. \u00a0 For Christmas that year my brother and I had a TV for our room, so that negated the need a bit for TV fighting. \u00a0 That moment of celebration is something that has stuck with me for almost 30 years.<\/p>\n<p>It was a major point of my life that I carried through regular watching until it was canceled in 1994. \u00a0I&#8217;ll always be the Star Wars is better guy, but hour for hour of viewing &#8211; Star Trek has likely edged out Star Wars for eyeball time. When I was born Star Trek had already been canceled for 7 years. \u00a0 I probably gravitated to it when I was five or six, possibly younger. \u00a0It was already an old show.<\/p>\n<p>The last Star Trek series was canceled in 2005, or roughly 4 years before my son was born. \u00a0 He is seven and has been brought up on Star Trek. \u00a0It&#8217;s almost exclusively the original series or the next generation. \u00a0 I showed him the video at the top of this post and he said that&#8217;s awesome. \u00a0 I don&#8217;t think he has the same passion for it, but then again I pulled him away from the Lego Movie video game \u00a0to show it to him. \u00a0He may have been distracted. \u00a0However, I did see a glimpse of hope, future, and excitement I had at 11. \u00a0 This is his moment to watch and experience something new in the Star Trek world at almost the same time as the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Since I doubt there will be a simulcast of the broadcast and online, that means he will likely be delayed a day of watching it. \u00a0 However, I think I want to recreate that first time for him as close it was for me. \u00a0 I want him excited (no I&#8217;m not a mean parent that is going to enforce my excitement upon him). \u00a0 I want to make a day and a show of it. \u00a0 \u00a0I want relive that moment with him, but at the same time I want to relive it for myself. \u00a0I want to start early evening playing video games. \u00a0 Then we can order pizza for dinner. \u00a0Unfortunately we live outside of Danny Boy&#8217;s delivery area. \u00a0 Then we will watch something Muppets related. \u00a0Finally it will be popcorn and the episode.<\/p>\n<p>Will he remember this 30 years afterwards? \u00a0I highly doubt it. \u00a0 It will be a moment that I will attempt to give him. \u00a0 At the the same time it&#8217;s not going to be as organic as it was for me the first time. \u00a0 My wife has a similar story being 8 years old and watching the premiere. \u00a0Her family was Star Trek obsessive though, so she didn&#8217;t have to run to the neighbors. \u00a0 My son has grown up in a unique culture of geekdom that neither my wife or I had. \u00a0He can literally and regularly bathe in the geek activities that wash over him. \u00a0 That&#8217;s why this likely won&#8217;t stick out the same way. \u00a0 At the end though, it might. \u00a0 In 30 years he might be writing about his experience of seeing a new Star Trek show for the first time. \u00a0 That&#8217;s something I would truly love to give him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>September 28, 1987 opened a new world for me.
