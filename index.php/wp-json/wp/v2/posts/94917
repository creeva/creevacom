I could now Airplay to both devices. \u00a0 Life is good.<\/p>\n<p>Since the only thing this new Wi-Fi\u00a0network will ever to handle is broadcast traffic from the LAN and Airplay traffic, the older speeds should be fine. \u00a0 I will likely purchase another 3-4 of these devices for various locations through the house. \u00a0 This should allow me to have an ok full house audio deployment without investing like the SONOS. \u00a0 Before moving the Airport Express solution I attempted to make an Airplay destination out of a Raspberry Pi &#8211; the audio was too choppy to really be playable. \u00a0 I wish that solution had worked &#8211; but it is what it is. \u00a0 I can buy updated versions of the Pi, but that cost would likely be larger than used Airport Expresses.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully this article helps someone from spending days trying to make this work with limited frustrations. \u00a0It wasn&#8217;t fun &#8211; but it&#8217;s cheap and working.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Recently I was re-architecting my home network. \u00a0 One of the main things I wanted to work with was whole house audio. \u00a0In two rooms of the house currently we have Apple TV&#8217;s hooked &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":94918,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94917"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=94917"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/94917\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/94918"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=94917"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=94917"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=94917"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
