it wasn&#8217;t demanding and fast paced enough. \u00a0 I am not one to really sit back on his hands. \u00a0 I prefer to be in the thick of things.<\/p>\n<p>I know a few people going back to school. \u00a0Some are doing it for the passion of it. \u00a0 Some are doing it to make connections. \u00a0 The rest are just trying to make more money or find a job at all. \u00a0 There is nothing wrong for those trying college to attempt to get ahead (though I don&#8217;t really believe in the college system). \u00a0 The ones that are doing it and placing themselves in debt for a job that won&#8217;t cover the cost in money or time &#8211; are just delusional.<\/p>\n<p>They will sit back and attempt to guess at how much they will make if they finish that degree. \u00a0 They choose degrees based not on personal interests, but instead based on\u00a0hire-ability. \u00a0These people are going to be as miserable in their career as I was in the job that almost destroyed me. \u00a0 If it isn&#8217;t something you love, you should not be looking to do it full-time.<\/p>\n<p>One example I can point to is the people who don&#8217;t use computers. \u00a0 This isn&#8217;t about the people that never had the time to learn. \u00a0It isn&#8217;t about those that it never crossed their paths. \u00a0 I know plenty of people in the IT world that are great with computers. \u00a0 Some of them do not use computers at all when they are off of work. \u00a0 I&#8217;ve known people in the industry for a couple of decades that do not even have a personal email address. \u00a0 I just can&#8217;t comprehend this. \u00a0I can&#8217;t think about not using a computer.<\/p>\n<p>This makes me think of the people who go and get a business degree and hate math or politics. \u00a0Both of those play heavily into the business world. \u00a0 If you hate math, working in a business unit is a bad time. \u00a0 If you can&#8217;t stand politics and can&#8217;t play them, it&#8217;s\u00a0a tough road climbing a corporate ladder. \u00a0 They will be able to say they got hired right out of graduation and might make 40k a year to start &#8211; but at what cost?<\/p>\n<p>If you are not happy with what you do, you have sacrificed the most expensive thing in the world &#8211; time. \u00a0 Time is what you use to relax. \u00a0Time is what you do to have fun. \u00a0 Once gone it can never be recovered. \u00a0 You can&#8217;t earn more of it. \u00a0No matter how much money you make or how little of it you have earned, everyone is fairly equal on the amount of time they have. \u00a0 Even if you become a millionaire you lose if the homeless guy on the street corner has had a more fulfilling life than you have had.<\/p>\n<p>When I went to school my family asked what I planned to do with my music performance degree. \u00a0I said I didn&#8217;t know. \u00a0 They thought I should choose business. \u00a0My reply was that I would rather be homeless on the street corner playing trumpet than be stuck in a\u00a0cubicle. \u00a0 I&#8217;ve done my fair share of cubicle time, but it was with things I loved &#8211; not from what I would have learned from a business degree. \u00a0 So now they don&#8217;t have to worry about me, and I&#8217;m still doing something that I love more than playing the trumpet. \u00a0Computers really are my strongest passion.<\/p>\n<p>Without the passion you will never be fulfilled. \u00a0 You can buy toys and large houses, but you will probably be spending over seventeen hundred hours a year hating life and not enjoying it. \u00a0 Is that something you really want to do? \u00a0Wouldn&#8217;t you prefer to live more simply and enjoy life at something that may pay less? \u00a0If not, which life would you want for your child?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
