Options include the ability to only tweet the articles you submit rather than digg, pause the service at anytime, change the frequency of when to check digg, completly remove your twiggit account.<\/p>\n<p>There is nothing like this in the market, we aim to bring digg and twitter closer together!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/twiggit.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/twiggit.org\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Any questions please let me know \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>Jason<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It took me a few days to add this onto my plate, but I did get around to signing up for the website. At one time I attempted to crosspost all of my online activities over to twitter &#8211; this got way to spammy. When I set it up this account I configured itto send everything I submit on <a href=\"http:\/\/digg.com\/users\/creeva\" class=\"broken_link\">Digg<\/a> to crosspost over to <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/creeva\">Twitter<\/a>. Since I sometimes will go on a digg spree and digg 50 stories in a day I didn&#8217;t want all of them to show up as tweets. Props to them for thinking about this.<\/p>\n<p>To test this out <a href=\"http:\/\/digg.com\/movies\/Can_Anyone_Name_This_Movie_For_Me\" class=\"broken_link\">I submitted a recent story I wrote onto Digg<\/a> attempting to find out a title about <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/09\/08\/can-anyone-name-this-movie-for-me\/\" class=\"broken_link\">a movie I was tracking down<\/a>. The product works as designed. All in all there is no frills, it&#8217;s single purpose &#8211; but single purpose that works quite well. There are other methods of doing this such as importing feeds into twitter &#8211; but while Twiggit is essentially doing this at the back end &#8211; it makes it easier for people that would be intimidated by the level of understanding that this takes. Twiggit is something I would send over so my parents could set up (if any of them used Digg or Twitter), versus something psuedo complex that I would have ot configure for them.<\/p>\n<p>On the downsides, there website shows the following image:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/twiggit.org\/img\/screen2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"234\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you look at the bottom of the image it says it received it 2 minutes ago from Twiggit. This acknowledgment seems to be missing from <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/creeva\/statuses\/913930413\">my tweet<\/a> which states submitted 1 hour ago from web. I&#8217;m assuming this is a bug.<\/p>\n<p>All in all Twiggit is not something groundbreaking, but it&#8217;s deserves it&#8217;s niche. In the era we are moving into of micro-niches it fits in quite nicely. With all the sites that integrate with Twitter, Twitter needs to start setting up a developer API similar to Google or Flickr so we don&#8217;t actually have to give these sites our Twitter usernames and passwords. That however is a rant for another day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Originally the title mentioned Twiggit.com &#8211; which is the parent website of twiggit.org &#8211; the application is at twiggit.org.
