The reason is I didn&#8217;t put out anything that was more technical or more scathing than some other sites I saw after the fact when I wrote that.<\/p>\n<p>It seems some of my hits seem to be from people more interested specifically in Palantir and looking for more information. I would assume that the Palantir hits were part of a bot program &#8211; but it seems some of these links originated from e-mail accounts &#8211; so they are sharing my humble story.<\/p>\n<p>I do applaud Palantir on <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.palantirtech.com\/2007\/09\/11\/palantir-screenshots\/\" class=\"broken_link\">updating their screenshots<\/a> &#8211; it seems they are showing off some of what they have accomplished now. The only thing I have to say to Palantir is the website has moved and some articles are now cross-posted &#8211; but I haven&#8217;t written anything new and it&#8217;s the same article you were tearing through months ago when I originally wrote the article.<\/p>\n<p>The other posts that are huge are my review on <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2007\/09\/11\/symantec-endpoint-protection-110\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Symantec Endpoint Protection<\/a>, my &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2007\/10\/29\/hulu-another-good-tv-links-replacement\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Hulu &#8211; Another good Tv-Links Replacement<\/a>&#8220;, and <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2007\/10\/22\/teddys-place-tv-links-replacements\/\" class=\"broken_link\">My link to TV-Links replacement sites<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m hoping with the launch of my new site in the next 24 hours that I start to receive a wider variety of people reading a wider variety of stuff.
