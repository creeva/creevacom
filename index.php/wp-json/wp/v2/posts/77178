This carousel came to the park in 1946 and I&#8217;m going to say that it was one of my first rides at the park. I&#8217;ve ridden it a few times, but I don&#8217;t really have any interesting pointers or stories about it. I&#8217;m sure my son will love it for a few years. \u00a0Let&#8217;s move to the Midway in general. While I am going to go more in-depth about the general attractions later, if you want a complete run through of the Midway from a personal view check out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tour-the-point.com\/MainMidway.htm\">this page I found over here<\/a>. \u00a0I can remember the Midway through its different ages, unfortunately I think it has been 6 years since I&#8217;ve been to CP. \u00a0 Looking at the current map a lot of the Midway&#8217;s heart is\u00a0missing &#8211; but that is only from an abstract sketch.<\/p>\n<p> So here is how entering Cedar Point in the 80&#8217;s worked for non-season pass holders (this is important since season pass holders know more tricks). \u00a0You would drive down the main causeway looking out over Lake Erie. \u00a0 Once you entered the parking lot you went to the first available aisle that the parking attendant directed you to. \u00a0 You would then haul your picnic basket over the picnic areas on either side of park entrance. \u00a0 On good years we had stopped at the KFC on the way to the park and we had that for lunch and again for dinner. \u00a0 We normally used the picnic area\u00a0on the east side of the entrance.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image by\u00a0<a id=\"yui_3_4_0_3_1329922814373_1314\" href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/people\/vlastula\/\">Vlasta Juricek<\/a>\u00a0on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/vlastula\/6739045885\/\">Flickr<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0 You then went and purchased your tickets at the kiosk booths only to run into the gambit of photographers. \u00a0The photographers at Cedar Point are worse than the homeless in NYC. \u00a0 So much begging to take your picture so they could give you a little tag where you could buy it later in the day. \u00a0 Back then you didn&#8217;t even get to buy a &#8220;picture&#8221;, you purchased this little key chain you looked through to see an image of your wonderful day arriving at Cedar Point. \u00a0 At least it was a wonderful day before you got\u00a0harassed\u00a0by the photographers. \u00a0 \u00a0You then hand your ticket to the ticket collector and go through the turnstiles. \u00a0 In front of you is the Midway, the welcoming you to the park.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to take this minute and point out some of the things the season pass holders are aware of. \u00a0 A season pass holder hardly ever drives up the main causeway. \u00a0They will take the back road that goes right on the lake past all\u00a0the\u00a0summer houses. \u00a0 Upon arriving to the park lot we do a few things. \u00a0Either we park in one of the back parking lots and skip the main entrance or we just drive past the parking attendant (sometimes we have to say we are dropping someone off) \u00a0and drive to the front.<\/p>\n<p>Workers are always coming and going and it is always trivial to find a parking spot a the very front of the lot. \u00a0 You can actually see this in the parking lot photo above. \u00a0I can only think of one time we couldn&#8217;t find one. \u00a0Season pass holder normally can save at least 30 minutes here &#8211; granted we normally saved it by arriving at noon. \u00a0 Anyways&#8230;.back to the Midway.<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center><\/p>\n<pre><\/pre>\n<p>Looking at the video above and even pictures the look of the Midway is\u00a0 by the loss of the Demon Drop (this of course is my\u00a0personal opinion). \u00a0 Seeing that as one of the eye openers before you even go into the park is what really sold the Midway to me. \u00a0 About half the park including most of the carnival games, kiddy land, most of the food, and a good part of the roller coasters are accessible from the main midway.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/people\/andrewb94\/\">Scene of The Main Midway taken by Andrew Borgen<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In 1906 the\u00a0Cedar Point Coliseum was originally constructed\u00a0as a ballroom \/ dance hall. \u00a0 It was one of the main draws before it became a modern style amusement park. \u00a0It attracted people from miles around. Without this building there would not\u00a0be a Cedar Point today. \u00a0I do suggest you read up on the history of the park to see all the great acts that have performed there. \u00a0 It wasn&#8217;t until my high school years that I even knew there was a functioning upstairs. \u00a0I thought it was just one of those areas used for storage.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m guessing it was the summer between my freshman and sophomore year that I had a youth group event for the Methodist church that took place at Cedar Point. \u00a0 Youth groups from all around congregated to spend the day at Cedar Point, and in the middle hold a worship ceremony. \u00a0 The worship ceremony and some other events took place in the ballroom upstairs. \u00a0 It was huge with hardwood floors. \u00a0it looked dated &#8211; but it was kept up. \u00a0Years after you can just go up the stairs and look inside. \u00a0The doors are\u00a0if there isn&#8217;t an event going on, but no one ever seemed to blink if it went upstairs to take a look.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/people\/andrewb94\/\">The Coliseum taken by Andrew Borgen<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In my last story I stated that I would get to the great arcade scam of 1989 in this post. \u00a0 Remember kids, this was 23 years ago (HOLY CRAP!), so I wouldn&#8217;t recommend trying this today. \u00a0 We didn&#8217;t have to deal with video cameras around every turn. \u00a0 There was generally two to four of us that went Cedar Point together on any given day. \u00a0Our mothers would rotate through dropping us off and picking us up. \u00a0 We would be there for around 8 hours and usually were given some money so we could eat. \u00a0 We were all addicted to the arcade. \u00a0 The Cedar Point arcade is still one of the greatest ones I have ever been to.<\/p>\n<p>It really wasn&#8217;t one arcade though, it was multiple throughout the park. \u00a0 There was one near the entrance that held a shooting gallery and very few video games. \u00a0 There was the unattended one in Hotel Breakers. \u00a0The concession area in front of Soak City (before you paid to go in) had one. \u00a0A small one (still bigger than your average mall arcade) located near the Gemini. \u00a0 There was at least one in Frontier town that was about twice the size of the Gemini one. \u00a0 Finally the huge one on the first floor of the Coliseum. \u00a0 I am next to positive I am missing one though. \u00a0 \u00a0So this is a grand total of six arcades in the park, but I am almost positive that I am missing one.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/mutantlog\/38458197\/in\/photostream\/\"><em>Photo by Ryan Bayne<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One day the change machine swallowed a five dollar bill without giving us any change. \u00a0We went up to the arcade attendant and told him what happened, he then proceeded to open the machine and returned our five dollar bill. \u00a0 We then realized that there was no checking he did to verify that we actually put money in the machine. \u00a0 Later we waited until we saw someone else put a five dollar bill into the machine. \u00a0 We then went up to the attendant and said we lost money in the machine again. \u00a0 He then proceeded to open it up and give us the five dollar bill.<\/p>\n<p>We would make the rounds in the park and normally do this at each arcade every other visit or so. \u00a0 All the money was promptly turned back into tokens and used in the arcade. \u00a0So the loss to Cedar Point was the minimal use of the arcade machines. \u00a0 We never used it to profit directly, we only wanted to fuel our video game desires. \u00a0 There was however a greater heist done by one of my friends when I was seventeen.<\/p>\n<p>I was at home in the middle of summer and one of my friends comes tearing into my house. \u00a0 He wanted me to come out to his car to see something. He opens this duffel bag filled with cedar point tokens. \u00a0 We are talking about hundreds of dollars of tokens. \u00a0 Since I wasn&#8217;t there I can only relay what he told me. \u00a0 I guess an arcade attendant was getting ready to refill one of the token machines and had it opened. \u00a0 While he was removing the real money he had the token bag beside him. \u00a0 While his back was to the token bag, my friend swiped the bag and took off running. \u00a0 He said the guy started to chase him, but couldn&#8217;t go far since the real money part of the machine was still open. \u00a0 \u00a0If the arcade attendants had used radios back then my buddy would have been screwed.<\/p>\n<p>We did return almost all the tokens back to Cedar Point &#8211; one at a time. \u00a0 He would leave the duffel bag in the car and we would fill our pockets. \u00a0 We would just go to the arcade and waste hours and hours returning the tokens. \u00a0 Those were the years I would stay and play completely through one video game at a time until I beat it. \u00a0 Those were great days.<\/p>\n<p>In the next part I will cover the Cadillac Cars, the Antique Cars, and the Turnpike Cars.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/mutantlog\/38888572\/\"><em>Picture by Ryan Bayne<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The next attraction in my weird chronology at Cedar Point is the Midway Carousel.
