iconic and an important part of my growing up. \u00a0 If I was ever out of money for video games at <a href=\"http:\/\/cedarpoint.com\">Cedar Point<\/a>, I would ride the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Demon_Drop\">Demon Drop<\/a> and recover some more change. \u00a0 It was always the ride that kept on giving.<\/p>\n<p>Cedar Point whisked this away in the winter before the 2010 season of the park. \u00a0 What was the staple of the Cedar Point skyline was removed. \u00a0Even though Gatekeeper is the new showcase entrance ride, I still think it looked better with the Demon Drop. \u00a0 The 2010 season was sad when the ride was no longer there. \u00a0 Part of my childhood and been remodeled and removed. \u00a0It was\u00a0put back into the toy chest and lost to the hands of time. \u00a0 At least it was until yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>The Demon Drop was moved to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dorneypark.com\/\">Dorney Park in Pennsylvania<\/a>. \u00a0 When I&#8217;m at home this park is about a 6 hour drive away. \u00a0 While the Demon Drop is an iconic memory, I&#8217;m not sure it was a 6 hour drive of meaning to me to revisit. \u00a0 Luckily the stars aligned and I was doing some work about 75 minutes away. \u00a0It was definitely worth less than an hour and half to go visit. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t have time in June when I found out about the proximity, but I planned to go in July. \u00a0 Yesterday after work I made the hike to the park.<\/p>\n<p>Having a platinum pass really worked out for this. \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t have to pay for parking or anything to get into the park. \u00a0It only cost in me in toll roads and time. \u00a0 When I got off the turnpike though 6:45PM, it was pouring rain. \u00a0I drove almost an hour and a half and was greeted to fear that it was all for nothing. \u00a0 I soldiered on with hope.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to write about Dorney Park in a follow-up post, but when I got into the park all the big rides were closed. \u00a0 Some of the smaller rides were still running though. \u00a0 I could see in the distance that the Demon Drop wasn&#8217;t running. \u00a0 I had some time to kill and hope that the rain stopped.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94213\"

\u00a0 I start heading over to where it is located. \u00a0 \u00a0There are eight people waiting and I get into the line and watch the testing. \u00a0 The car I saw was crawling up, it looked slower than the Demon Drop looked at Cedar Point before they upgraded the motor. \u00a0 The car struggled up and made it to the top. \u00a0 It then did the drop.<\/p>\n<p>The sound was glorious. \u00a0 It was the sound that you heard thousands of times in your youth as you walked from the parking lot into the park. \u00a0It was an aural equivalent that takes you back to childhood in the way certain tastes and smells do. \u00a0 It was surreal and magnificent. \u00a0 This is why I came. \u00a0This is why I drove over an hour, walked around a park in the rain, and endured on. \u00a0 I came to relive this moment of childhood that disappeared from Ohio in 2009.<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center><center><em>Footage I shot of the test<\/em><\/center><center><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter

loads 3 cars at a time). \u00a0 I was riding by myself, which was something that I probably haven&#8217;t done on the Demon Drop in over 25 years. \u00a0 The first thing I noticed, in the space behind the seat cushion they added a bar all the way across about 3\/4 inch wide. \u00a0This stopped you from \u00a0reaching back and checking for change (which habit forced me to do). \u00a0 While the ride should be the same, part of the ritual and experience from the past is gone from future generations.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94216\"

second car went up and I moved back 3-4 feet &#8211; again the sound. \u00a0 Then I started going up the tower. It actually went up quite quick. \u00a0 Talking to my wife about it later, she reminded me about the upgraded motor toward the end of its Cedar Point tenure. \u00a0I get to the top and see the tire that helps roll it forward. \u00a0 The tire looks fresh and new (something that I wasn&#8217;t used to from the Demon Drop). \u00a0The car moved forward to the drop area. \u00a0 I waited.<\/p>\n<p>The worst part (best part?) about the Demon Drop is the intermittent delay. \u00a0No matter how many times you rode it, the time you sat there waiting to drop was always a few seconds different. \u00a0 I&#8217;ve ridden it where it has been over 10 seconds and sometimes it was less than a single second. \u00a0It&#8217;s an anticipation that makes it so you aren&#8217;t sure when it&#8217;s going to drop. \u00a0 I was contemplating this and I was still waiting.<\/p>\n<p>The slight butterflies of the past came flooding back, what if &#8211; <strong>drop!<\/strong> I was falling. \u00a0I was feeling the air. \u00a0I was hearing the sound. \u00a0I was a teenager again for a brief instant. \u00a0 I came to the end and the car\u00a0swung down and took me back to the terminal. \u00a0 It was over.<\/p>\n<p>When I was getting out the attendant asked me if I enjoyed my ride. \u00a0I told her that it was the only reason I came to the park. \u00a0 She was a little surprised and I explained that I grew up with it at a Cedar Point. \u00a0 We talked a bit more and then I wandered down the ramp. \u00a0 It was 8:57. \u00a0The park would close in an hour. \u00a0 What do I do now?<\/p>\n<p>I thought about just chain riding the demon drop for an hour. \u00a0 However, I didn&#8217;t really want to dilute what made the moment special. \u00a0 The sound and the experience of the single ride made all the rain driving and rain worth it. \u00a0 The Demon Drop wasn&#8217;t even my favorite Cedar Point ride, the Gemini is. \u00a0 I wish I could say it was my favorite lost Cedar Point ride &#8211; but that is tie between the Pirate Ride and The Paddleboat. \u00a0 It is however,\u00a0a very special experience.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing I wanted the moment to stay, I went around the park to hit some more rides. \u00a0 I decided I would ride it one more time before I left, but I would leave that for the end. \u00a0 Around 9:53 I was back in line. \u00a0 By 9:57 I was in the second to last car of the night. \u00a0 I was exhausted by going through the park. \u00a0 I might have been able to get in line one more time and get the last ride &#8211; but I decided to leave things as they were.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-94217\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/2015-07-21-21.51.43-1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"2015-07-21 21.51.43\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/2015-07-21-21.51.43-1-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/2015-07-21-21.51.43-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/2015-07-21-21.51.43-1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/2015-07-21-21.51.43-1-1070x1427.jpg 1070w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/2015-07-21-21.51.43-1.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It was awesome.
