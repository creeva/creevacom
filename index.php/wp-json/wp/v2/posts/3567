was the crawl space above the garage that you had to use a\u00a0 ladder to get up there.<\/p>\n<p>My eleven year old sister wanted to climb up and help.\u00a0 My mother said it was too dangerous and wouldn&#8217;t allow it.\u00a0\u00a0 My nine year old brother then threw a temper tantrum that he wanted to come up and was really throwing a fit.\u00a0 My mother was going ot allow him to come up.\u00a0\u00a0 My sister still couldn&#8217;t come up because it was too dangerous for her still.\u00a0\u00a0 I wasn&#8217;t going to allow it.\u00a0\u00a0 I didn&#8217;t allow my brother to come up either.\u00a0 If it was too dangerous for his older sister, it was too dangerous for him.\u00a0 My mother pleaded with me to allow him to come up.\u00a0\u00a0 I said no, if she couldn&#8217;t be consistent with her decision, I wasn&#8217;t going to support her inconsistencies.<\/p>\n<p>My youngest brother was still throwing a fit but I shrugged it off.\u00a0 My little brother (was not sure about now) the dictionary definition of a spoiled child.\u00a0 He would run wild and do whatever he wanted.\u00a0 My mother would support it and give him whatever he asked for, allowing him to do things that were &#8220;too dangerous&#8221; for his older sister, and the boy would not take no for an answer.<\/p>\n<p>One time when I was babysitting the boy I sent him to his room for punishment.\u00a0\u00a0 He wouldn&#8217;t stay in the room so I applied a trick I learned when my next in line brother had that room.\u00a0\u00a0 If you looped a strap around the door handle to the bathroom door handle immediately across the hall you couldn&#8217;t get out.\u00a0\u00a0 This I admit was exasperation mode for me, since I didn&#8217;t want to spank a kid that was twenty-one years younger then me.\u00a0\u00a0 The kid didn&#8217;t want to stay in that room and thought no one could force him (since my mother never disciplined him.\u00a0\u00a0 While I was sitting on the stairs working (right outside the door) he wsa taking apart his window and trying to climb out of the second floor since he felt no one had the right to punish him.<\/p>\n<p>Before you think this is my babysitting norm or I was endangering the child.\u00a0 His only stipulation was that he had to go stay in his room for 15 minutes straight. \u00a0 That obviously was too much for him, so that&#8217;s why it came down to locking him in for fifteen minutes.<\/p>\n<p>My mother never wanted to be a mother.\u00a0 She wanted to give the love (in her own wway) but she would always let the youngest child run wild and do whatever they wanted. \u00a0 It just snowballed down to the extreme with my youngest brother.\u00a0 She was in love with being a mother, the same way a little girl is in love with a having a doll.\u00a0 She wanted children around to dress and show off, yet didn&#8217;t want to discipline, didn&#8217;t want to teach anything of value, and didn&#8217;t want to deal with anything bothersome.<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 2 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 3 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday I gave you the setup of what was going on when I first got back, let&#8217;s keep filling you in.\u00a0\u00a0 Even though I didn&#8217;t live in the house I was becoming the man of &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3567"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3567"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3567\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3567"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3567"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3567"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
