But 7 years away playing all different MMO&#8217;s, with more polish and content, creating and levelling characters, (and in the case playing them for a lot longer) I never found myself truly attached to the game, I felt attached to the people, but there was always something missing, so after 7 years, I actually finally feel&#8230; Home, there is just something about SWG that gives you that feeling.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I think that is a great synopsis. \u00a0Nothing else ever feels right. \u00a0I&#8217;ve played many other online roleplaying games. \u00a0 None of them fit quite right. \u00a0They are all over simplified, or lack a true player economy, mediocre crafting system, or nothing to build a community. \u00a0 I&#8217;m happy to have the old outfit that always fit perfectly back.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; It has been one full week that I have been in the Emu. \u00a0 What I want to do keeps changing in the game. \u00a0 I was going to grind up Rifleman, but I &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93140,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93139"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93139"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93139\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93140"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93139"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93139"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93139"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
