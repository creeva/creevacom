What I want to do keeps changing in the game. I was going to grind up Rifleman, but I didn&#8217;t have a rifle yet. I decided to use my CDEF pistol and grind up that line for now. Unfortunately, everything in the game hits a lot hard than I remember.<\/p>\n<p>I decided try try the unarmed line to go for TKM. This feels more natural to me now. I&#8217;m sure it is because the entertainer was the unarmed melee class in the NGE era. For the moment things feel correct. It all depends on what I want to do with Creeva. This character will be wiped once 1.0 hits, so this is more of a time to play with all the classes I never did in SWG proper. I&#8217;m even considering trying to do Master Ranger. That&#8217;s just crazy talk.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday I spent all my time doing surveying\u00a0pseudo\u00a0AFK. I was watching the screen, but also watching Mad Men at the same time. I made it through two boxes before I went to bed. When I woke up this morning he had finished the third box and maxed out XP. At least it gets ore for the city.<\/p>\n<p>I could never ATK non-macro sample level &#8211; that would drive me nuts. Of course I leveled entertainer multiple times all ATK, and that drives some people nuts. Everyone has their own grind hatred in the game.<\/p>\n<p>The crazy thing is how many of the old players form Intrepid are coming out of the wood work. We are all working together in some shape to &#8220;put on a show&#8221; (<em>build the city<\/em>). It is fantastic. The community that I loved is together in some way shape or form.<\/p>\n<p>I did explain to one of my flesh and blood friends that Star Wars Galaxies is the most complicated MMO every designed. I realized that after Xie and I both spent over an hour explaining the\u00a0interdependencies and what makes it more complicated, we still barely touched the surface. It&#8217;s a game where the complications just keep going and going.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a post a friend on Facebook put up:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I used to think I just looked back fondly at SWG and if I relived it, it wouldn&#8217;t measure up and I&#8217;d be disappointed. But 7 years away playing all different MMO&#8217;s, with more polish and content, creating and levelling characters, (and in the case playing them for a lot longer) I never found myself truly attached to the game, I felt attached to the people, but there was always something missing, so after 7 years, I actually finally feel&#8230; Home, there is just something about SWG that gives you that feeling.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I think that is a great synopsis. Nothing else ever feels right. I&#8217;ve played many other online roleplaying games. None of them fit quite right. They are all over simplified, or lack a true player economy, mediocre crafting system, or nothing to build a community. I&#8217;m happy to have the old outfit that always fit perfectly back.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; It has been one full week that I have been in the Emu.
