When my son was past his first birthday, he noticed thunderstorms for the first time. It was like a switch went off, he never noticed them before and then he became deathly afraid of them. We attempted to explain to him what was going on, but it wasn&#8217;t sinking in. Granted how much really does sink into a one-year-old when you are dealing with how nature works?<\/p>\n<p>I quickly came up with an idea. He loves music and songs, so why don&#8217;t we make it into a game? I searched through my playlist and couldn&#8217;t find anything that would help. Then I saw, Thunderstruck by AC\/DC. Within a few minutes, we had him singing along with the chorus. We kept up the next couple of times that there was a thunderstorm, and it sunk in. He no longer was deathly afraid of the storm, but instead would sing &#8220;Thunder &#8211; Woahhhhh Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhh&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>To this day it is still one of his favorite songs and he&#8217;ll occasionally bust it out when a storm is going on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was listening to the storm earlier today and I was reminded of my son.
