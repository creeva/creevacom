I hope your moral certainty gives you peace of mind.\u00a0\u00a0 The sad thing since taking credit for the attacks Bin Laden has become more of a figurehead than anything else.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 People love figureheads.\u00a0 The world was fascinated Friday by the marriage of two figureheads.\u00a0 Two people who have no power, just the appearance of it.<\/p>\n<p>Since 9\/11 Bin Laden&#8217;s organization became even more underground.\u00a0\u00a0 Cells became self-sufficient and were taught just to cause harm.\u00a0 They were no longer centrally controlled.\u00a0 Instead of a single organization it became dozens, if not hundreds.\u00a0\u00a0 They have multiplied like rats and we don&#8217;t know where they are.\u00a0\u00a0 We don&#8217;t know who the leaders are of all these organizations.\u00a0\u00a0 We did manage to take out the figurehead who went on to design an organization that would last without him.\u00a0\u00a0 He couldn&#8217;t give any further direct orders to these cells.\u00a0 He was in all intents and purpose a powerless figurehead.<\/p>\n<p>But we killed Bin Laden that means we won right?????<\/p>\n<p>Because of his actions, America has entered 2 major wars.\u00a0 America has lost thousands of lives.\u00a0 America has entered into an era of crushing debt for both the country and the citizen.\u00a0\u00a0 We have lost basic freedoms.\u00a0\u00a0 We have given up our civil liberties in the name of freedom.\u00a0\u00a0 None of this has really made us more secure.\u00a0\u00a0 Almost all the attacks on airplanes we have heard of since 9\/11 was stopped by the passengers.\u00a0 They were not stopped by homeland security or the TSA.\u00a0\u00a0 As I&#8217;ve been told by everyone who loves guns &#8211; America can defend itself.\u00a0 Instead of defending itself we&#8217;ve become a nanny state.\u00a0\u00a0 It goes down from the youngest baby to the oldest senior citizen.\u00a0\u00a0 Look what happened &#8211; you can&#8217;t defend yourself &#8211; let us defend you.\u00a0\u00a0 You only need us to do warrantless wire taps, groping of your person, and block freedom of speech.\u00a0\u00a0 We are so much safer and more America proud now.<\/p>\n<p><em>But we killed Bin Laden that means we won right?????<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We will guess that the 9\/11 operation cost under 1 million dollars.\u00a0\u00a0 The blow to American pride was huge.\u00a0\u00a0 How dare someone attack us on our soul.\u00a0 How dare he say that we are soft.\u00a0 How dare he say that we invade other countries and never leave.\u00a0 We are spreading freedom and it&#8217;s our god given right to spread it everywhere, even when we are not wanted.\u00a0\u00a0 Those are all the things Bin Laden did say about us.\u00a0\u00a0 If we are so strong why has the government taken away many of our freedoms?\u00a0\u00a0 If we never leave other countries how did he lie?\u00a0 If we overthrow existing governments how was he wrong?<\/p>\n<p>The problem was not with his message and how he felt &#8211; but by how he showed the world.\u00a0 It was a tragedy that I will remember where I heard about it.\u00a0 I remember the fear it caused inside of me.\u00a0\u00a0 There is absolutely no way to justify his actions.\u00a0\u00a0 He was a mad man who did the wrong things and paid the ultimate price for it.\u00a0\u00a0 The sad part is, even though he lost the majority of power as his organization morphed into something new.\u00a0 He became a symbol for Americans to hate.\u00a0 In death he is going to become a martyr for his cause.\u00a0\u00a0 In some ways I think it would be better if America never found Bin Laden.\u00a0 If he would have eventually drifted away until memory as someone who didn&#8217;t exist.\u00a0\u00a0 All the people who may have believed in him, now have a martyr whose existence has been validated.\u00a0 That scares the hell out of me even more than a boogeyman that might not even have truly existed.<\/p>\n<p><em>But we killed Bin Laden that means we won right?????<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Once again:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have lost civil liberties<\/li>\n<li>Our way of life has forever changed<\/li>\n<li>We have been in two wars for almost 10 years<\/li>\n<li>We are trillions of dollars in debt<\/li>\n<li>His organization is even harder to destroy<\/li>\n<li>He has become a martyr<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some of you feel safer now, thinking the boogeyman has been destroyed.\u00a0\u00a0 I fear the legacy that he has left.\u00a0\u00a0 I fear the real damage that will be caused by the groups spawned from his will be devastating and coming soon.\u00a0 I fear that things will get completely out of control now.\u00a0\u00a0 I fear the intangible damage that he has caused this country that we will never recover from.\u00a0\u00a0 I live in fear of the world my son will inherit, since my world is much different from the world of my father.\u00a0\u00a0 Bin Laden , however I haven&#8217;t feared in a long time.\u00a0 I fear him now more than I feared him on 9\/11.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever you think of his message, we all agree that 9\/11 was a horrendous even that never should have occurred.\u00a0\u00a0 Whether he did 9\/11 or not &#8211; it gave him a platform which allowed the world to listen to him and take him seriously.\u00a0\u00a0 He caused the American way of life to change dramatically, even changing our course for the future from something different from what it would have been.\u00a0 For that I weep for America.\u00a0 I understand your celebration and your feeling of a minor victory.\u00a0 Your lives however have not changed from where they were the last week.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Please put this into perspective to the big picture and not your own overgrown pride.<\/p>\n<p><em>But we killed Bin Laden that means we won right?????<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Yes, no, maybe &#8211;
