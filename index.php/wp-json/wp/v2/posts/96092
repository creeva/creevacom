I&#8217;m now working on &#8220;maybe one-day&#8221; items. So this lead to Feedburner.com. You see, Feedburner and I go back a long time. Back when APIs were hard to come by and RSS feeds ruled the world &#8211; I routed all my accounts through the Feedburner. It also has the advantage of generating daily emails of RSS items which I still have for historical tracking. I was using it as IFTTT before IFTTT was a thing. It was my central hub which I could manipulate data from. <\/p> <p>However, let&#8217;s just say it has been a few years since Feedburner and I had any real contact. Saying it has been a decade would likely be about accurate. I showed up sheepishly and looked around, kind of asked how it was going, and just checked in. While on the surface everything seemed to be chugging along as I left it &#8211; underneath the still waters was some anger. You see while 10-15 years ago might have been the height of public profiles and web services &#8211; many of those did not go on. <\/p> <p>I started by clicking the feed information for the most likely dead and buried web services. Instead of pulling up a page, it showed a 404 error. Then I did the same thing. Feeds that I knew did exist and were good are still working correctly. So while I have the bulk of the work done &#8211; I had to wade through over 100 different feeds. Kind of clicking and saying &#8220;hey I haven&#8217;t been to this domain in a decade what is going on&#8221;. <\/p> <p>The most amusing to me is the domains that were purchased by other companies. Later they&#8217;ll be going through their referral log and go what is this? I&#8217;ve had to have deleted over 60 defunct and dead feeds. Some of the services it was meh &#8211; I only used them to test the service. Other services gave me a mental tear going down my face &#8211; some good service names or web apps went to dust. <\/p> <p>We are now in 2021 and instead of RSS feeds being heavily prevalent (and back when I used to do massive cross-posting) &#8211; now it&#8217;s all APIs and cross-posting is almost dead. It was a different time and a different era. In many ways, the internet has gotten smaller &#8211; or maybe just less brave in putting out new ideas. Many things moved to apps and some of those apps don&#8217;t even have standard web page front ends anymore. The idea of the open-sharing web is almost completely dead. <\/p> <p>Here I am writing on a blog. A personal blog not monetized &#8211; just sharing my thoughts away. This site itself is a dinosaur of another era. Someday all of it gets trapped and vanishes into the tar pits. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I&#8217;m going through the daily journal generation script I previously mentioned, I made it to the point that I have most of what I can grab on a daily basis.
