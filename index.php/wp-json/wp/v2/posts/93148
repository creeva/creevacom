ride. \u00a0 He has done the train, the antique cars, and the turnpike cars &#8211; but beyond that he had not ridden any of the other adult rides. \u00a0 That changed with two new additions.<\/p>\n<p>The first was the Calypso. \u00a0 We played a few of &#8220;yes, I will go on it&#8221; and &#8220;there is no way I&#8217;m going near that&#8221;. \u00a0 It went so far that once we were boarding he gave a big nope. \u00a0 I carried him over the exit gate and let him off with Xie. \u00a0 Then he saw I was going to ride it still and wanted to try. \u00a0 So I went back and got him and took out seat.<\/p>\n<p>The ride attendant came up and he said he wanted to get off. \u00a0 She then asked him if he was sure, and he said he wanted to stay. \u00a0 After she left I told Lex he was committed. \u00a0 The ride started and he flipped. \u00a0 \u00a0He said it was too fast. \u00a0 I just held him extremely close and tight so he wouldn&#8217;t try anything that would make sense to a three and half-year old. \u00a0 He griped the whole time, but we made it through the ride with no injuries.<\/p>\n<p>When the ride was done he was moving quick to get off the ride. \u00a0 This is the exact opposite behavior that occurs when he rides something in Kiddie Land. \u00a0 When he made it back to Xie he climbed into her arms. \u00a0 She asked if he had fun. \u00a0He said yes. \u00a0 She asked if he would ride it again. \u00a0He said when he is bigger.<\/p>\n<p>The second adult ride we went on together was Dodgem. \u00a0 Which is the standard bumper car ride. \u00a0 The big deal with this was that he actually had to wait in line. \u00a0 Other rides like the Antique cars or the kiddie rides, he is usually just moving through line or walking on. \u00a0 This was not the case for the bumper cars.<\/p>\n<p>We had to wait for five or six ride cycles. \u00a0 Every single time Lex said &#8220;I&#8217;m ready Daddy.&#8221; \u00a0 Each time I had to explain to him we had to wait our turn. \u00a0 We were in line for a little over half an hour. \u00a0 He loved the ride and\u00a0insisted on steering. \u00a0He would also get quite angry at me when I whipped the steering wheel around to get him unstuck. \u00a0 Unlike the Calypso, he wanted to do the Dodgems again. \u00a0 I told him we would do it another day.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Image from Theme Park Review We went to Cedar Point on Saturday with Lex. \u00a0 He had a great time and I think he rode more rides than he has on any other visit. \u00a0 &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93149,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93148"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93148"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93148\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93149"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93148"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93148"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93148"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
