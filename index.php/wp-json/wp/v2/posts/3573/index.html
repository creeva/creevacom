However she couldn&#8217;t stop buying frivolous things at all. She was glued to the home shopping channel, when she didn&#8217;t have the money to buy something out right she would jump on their payment plan. When she was really excited about something she would call my grandmother.<\/p>\n<p>I swear something was being shipped to the house every other day from the home shopping network. If I had to venture a guess during the months between I moved back and when I cut off communication she had to spend the equivalent of a couple mortgage payments. It got to the point that she attempted to hide this purchases from me since she knew that she was going to get a lecture from me.<\/p>\n<p>She continued about how she needed her house modernized so it looked good &#8220;for the children&#8221;. This was her priority in her life. No job, no income, three children living under her roof, and she&#8217;s complaining about the flooring (which was adequate and better then some other people&#8217;s flooring).<\/p>\n<p>There was an extreme lack of food in the house. There was tons of dry cereal and maybe if you were lucky bread and peanut butter. She ordered out more then cooked anything meaningful, she would also go grocery shopping every day so she could get out of the house. Ironically she didn&#8217;t buy much of anything.<\/p>\n<p>My seventeen year old sister who was working had to buy her own food for lunch&#8217;s and mostly dinners also since &#8220;supper&#8221; conflicted with her work schedule. Now for some people this would seem like a fine thing to do, but my mother was getting hundreds of dollars a month in child support for my sister. Yet my sister never seemed to benefit from it. Instead I would have hear about my seventeen year old sister using my mother&#8217;s make-up or wearing my 12 year old sisters shirts (yes my sister was almost that small, but also liked tight fitting clothes). Never once did I hear her say anything good about my sister, it was more complaints on how much she cost or the attitude she gave.<\/p>\n<p>To my chagrin my grandparents paid to have new flooring done for Christmas. Sometimes I think my mother is as spoiled as my youngest brother.<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 2 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 3 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 4 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 5 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>During this time where really my mother was in complete financial distress and squeaking by.
