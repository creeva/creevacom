No Fun At All"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Friday night we went out shopping after I managed to get home from work. \u00a0 We were out later than normal. \u00a0 We went out to dinner so Lex could get to bed as close to his normal time as possible. \u00a0 We decided on Denny&#8217;s because it was quick and cheap. \u00a0We could also lie to ourselves that it is not fast food. \u00a0 As we went to pay, my card was declined. \u00a0 Then it was declined again. \u00a0 It was declined a third time. \u00a0 I was not a happy camper.<\/p>\n<p>I mentally worked things over in my head. \u00a0 There was no way that we did not have money in the account. \u00a0 Possibly one of my purchases was flagged as suspicious. \u00a0 I just didn&#8217;t know. \u00a0Xie didn&#8217;t have her wallet. \u00a0I did not have any cash on me. \u00a0 It was a perfect storm or problems.<\/p>\n<p>I did attempt to call my bank to see what was going on. \u00a0 I ended up in call tree purgatory without much luck getting through. \u00a0Lex was getting fussy and there was not much else I could do. \u00a0 I left my license with Denny&#8217;s and drove home to get money.<\/p>\n<p>On the way home I received a call from my bank. \u00a0It seems my card was used at two Wal-Marts and a Gas Station. \u00a0 These stores\u00a0were located in California. \u00a0 Seeing my normal usage was across the country, this is what tripped off the flags at the bank. \u00a0 You just can&#8217;t get from Ohio to California in less than hour, unless you are the Flash or Superman.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flash_(Barry_Allen)\">from Wikipedia<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The thieves did around 340.00 in transactions split between the three locations. \u00a0About a third of the money was done at each location. \u00a0 So for a quick recap, I don&#8217;t have a working debit card. \u00a0 It will take eight to ten days to replace the card. \u00a0I need to fill out a an affidavit that I did not make the charges. \u00a0 This will take me a couple weeks (after they send it to me) to have reversed. \u00a0 All in all it was terrible Friday news.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had to deal with this twice before. \u00a0 The first time was when Xie lost her debit card (<em>around 2003<\/em>). \u00a0It turned out the bank have given us both cards and they had the same numbers. \u00a0 I&#8217;m assuming they did this because it was a shared account. \u00a0 When they deactivated her account, they had to deactivate both of them. \u00a0 That was not a fun time.<\/p>\n<p>About four years ago someone was making purchases in Hong Kong. \u00a0That activity also flagged the system I had the fifty dollars reimbursed and a new card sent out to me. \u00a0 I suspect that the 2008 hack was an online retailer getting exploited. \u00a0 This time however I don&#8217;t know if it was an online hack, a skimmer, or an unscrupulous waiter or waitress.<\/p>\n<p>The one thing I don&#8217;t understand (if it is either a waiter or skimmer) is why don&#8217;t they use the cards locally. \u00a0 If the cards were used in the vicinity it would attract less attention. \u00a0Even if it was stolen online, you would think the resale of the numbers would be greater based on location. \u00a0Maybe this is the last step in stupidity that thieves will eventually conquer.<\/p>\n<p>Until I&#8217;m trying to understand how to deal in a cash based society again. \u00a0 I actually have to go into the gas station to pay for gas. \u00a0This is crazy talk.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;
