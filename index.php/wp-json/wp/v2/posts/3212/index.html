Theoretically, I&#8217;ve never been excited about a new browser that was announced. I remember being excited when <a href=\"http:\/\/aol.com\">AOL<\/a> resurrected <a href=\"http:\/\/netscape.com\">Netscape<\/a> &#8211; but that turned into a flaming pile of poo and Netscape lost dominance being THE browser to use. Like many users at that time frame, I used Internet Explorer 5 and at the time it was best of breed, then a new challenger arose.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/mozilla.org\">Mozilla <\/a>Foundation announced they were taking the open-source bits of the Netscape browser and making a new slimmer browser called Firebird. Because of issues of legal and copyright, Firebird was renamed to <a href=\"http:\/\/firefox.com\">Firefox<\/a>. I&#8217;ve been using this browser since Firebird and I have had no reason to move to a different primary browser. I&#8217;ve tried <a href=\"http:\/\/flock.com\">Flock<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apple.com\/safari\/\">Safari<\/a>, there hasn&#8217;t been a sticky reason to keep using those over Firefox. I was excited, kind of, about the release of Firefox version 3. But that wasn&#8217;t a new and different browser, it was more of the same.<\/p>\n<p>With last night&#8217;s announcement of <a href=\"http:\/\/googleblog.blogspot.com\/2008\/09\/fresh-take-on-browser.html\">Google&#8217;s New Chrome Browser<\/a>, they put up a nice <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/googlebooks\/chrome\/\">little <\/a>webcomic that explains the features it offers. The security, privacy, and performance enhancements alone make this a must-watch for browsers. When it is actually released later today, we&#8217;ll see how I feel then.<\/p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Found <a href=\"http:\/\/blogoscoped.com\/archive\/2008-09-02-n72.html\">a site that has some Chrome screenshots<\/a> you may enjoy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been excited about a new browser.
