Tonight, we sit down with the legendary Creeva Murkado for the first interview he has given since before his mysterious and much talk about disappearance.

Among them, you had been abducted by rebels, killed by pirates, had a nervous breakdown, suffered a drug overdose, committed suicide, were murdered by hutts \u2026 the list goes on. In fact, Ambassador Moyakashkaykrit even went so far as to claim a body had been found in Symphonia. What really happened? Where did you go? Billions of people want to know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">CM: Billions of people also want to know what\u2019s in our neighbouring galaxies.

Life had become so secure that I had stopped doing the second most important thing in my life \u2013 questioning things. When you stop examining who you are and where you are and what you are doing, you are no longer grounded. You cannot always look to the future. You need to be aware of the present and mindful of the past. To quote a great writer: \u201cThe past tempts us, the present confuses us, and the future frightens us.

How many people tried to get money from the media by enticing them with the truth about my disappearance? How many of those people are proven completely wrong by my sitting here and talking to you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">INT: Well\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">CM: Ask yourself this: If you had attained complete control of this station for several decades, where everything that was produced and broadcast was done only with your approval and then, one day, a letter came in with a bunch of signatures that said, \u201cPlease step down,\u201d would you? Would your first reaction be, \u201cHey, look they don\u2019t want me anymore, I\u2019ll just give all these years of being in command because they don\u2019t like me anymore?\u201d Do you really think that\u2019s what you\u2019d do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">INT: I suppose I wouldn\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">CM: In all that time, I\u2019ll bet you would have entrenched yourself with \u2018job security\u2019 assurances, allies, doctrine and procedure. You\u2019d use your position to further solidify itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">INT: Maybe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">CM: Well, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not true for everybody, and perhaps not for you, but what if you took your worst adversary in this station, in this entire organization and put them in the exact same position? What if you took your worst enemy in the entire galaxy and put him in that chair? What do you think he would do to protect his position?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">INT: Are you saying that Imperial Highness is your worst enemy?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">CM: One: You\u2019re deflecting the question, and I\u2019ll allow it, for your sake. Two: The Emperor is not my worst enemy. I am.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">INT: How so?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">CM: Nobody else in this entire galaxy could have nor can hurt me as much as I can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">INT: Is this tied to your disappearance?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">CM: Perhaps. Although my disappearance is more tied to a block of cheese than anything suggested by the press. Now, that producer of yours seems about ready to burst a vessel, so I think that\u2019s our cue. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">INT: [Chuckles] Well, thank you very much for coming by, Creeva.
