She thinks it is the most important thing in the world. Above keeping adequate food in the house even. If she needs something she&#8217;ll beg, plead, and cry until she gets her way. She is as spoiled as she has made any of her children.<\/p>\n<p>Her rational seems to be that people will look at her as a better person if she has a nicer house and furniture (a screwed assessment in my belief). Not only will they look at her as a better person, I honestly believe that she thinks it does make it her a better person. Should could have been Mother Theresa and feeding starving children on the streets of Calcutta and she would still be a terrible person in her mind if she didn&#8217;t have the greatest modern style in her house. <\/p>\n<p>My father did amazing work remodeling the house of my parents originally bought it. In the end it was a useful, functional, and livable house. My step-father isn&#8217;t too shabby at work also, yet his designs are not as well thought out. He (with I&#8217;m sure my mothers chiding) turned half the garage into a ten foot by ten foot dining room. It was cramped and never felt right. It also negated half the garage and made it so you couldn&#8217;t pull a car in any longer. To make matters worse he had to put one to two wall jacks for various services into each wall in the room. Idiotic for a dining room. If you need that kind of outlet space get a surge protector, because I know her didn&#8217;t put a better breaker in the house. <\/p>\n<p>My mother must have reached the realization at one point that this was a bad spot for a dining room. So she turned the front living room into a dining room. At first line this doesn&#8217;t sound too bad, until you realize there is no atrium or anything, so the dining room is the first room you enter when you walk into the house. <\/p>\n<p>The last time I was there the house was so transformed you could hardly recognize it anymore. What used to be a livable space that felt like a lived home is slowly being transformed into a model home that just has residents. It is not a place you would ever feel comfortable in. While it doesn&#8217;t look bad, it looks like no one lives there except for the mess, maybe weekend renters that haven&#8217;t cleaned up yet. A nice place to visit, but you wouldn&#8217;t want to live there. <\/p>\n<p>Read Part 1 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 2 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 3 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 4 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 5 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 6 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 7 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 8 Here<\/p>\n<p>Read Part 9 Here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My mother is obsessed with her house.
