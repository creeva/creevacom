Is it the treatment of the animals? No, I haven&#8217;t witnessed any animals at this point. Is it the prices they charge? No, as far as I know, I have no specific objection to their pricing structure. My issue with the Ashland Human Society is its poor service.<\/p>\n<p>I called this morning to confirm my appointment for the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rascalunit.com\/\">Rascal Unit<\/a> that was stopping by to run a pet care clinic. I was taking in the three youngest of my brood to get them spayed and neutered respectively. To show you what my main complaint is here is the e-mail I&#8217;m sending to Rascal Unit:<\/p>\n<p>Dear Rascal Unit,<\/p>\n<p>I regret to inform you of the poor responsiveness of your partner in offering pet care, the Ashland Humane Society. While I&#8217;m sure their intentions were well and their hearts are in the proper place, according to your web site with you calendar it stated as follows:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>January 27- Ashland County, Ohio<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Contact the Ashland Humane Society at 419 2814722 or e-mail <a href=\"mailto:ashlandhumane@yahoo.com\">ashlandhumane@yahoo.com<\/a> to make an appointment for this clinic date in this area.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Some of your calender dates show that you are able to make an appointment by e-mail or by phone call A good example of this is your calendar date for Dayton:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>January 16- Dayton, Ohio<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Contact the Humane Society of Greater Dayton at 937 268 PETS to schedule for this clinic date in this area.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This calendar entry has no e-mail address so it stresses the importance of calling. The reason this is an issue is that in your Ashland calendar entry, it treats it as if the e-mail and phone number are equal. I e-mailed my appointment and called this morning to verify what time you were going to be there.<\/p>\n<p>I addressed the lady who answered the phone and asked why I was calling and I explained I was just calling to see if the Rascal Unit had arrived yet, she confirmed it was and asked me about my appointment. I explained I had made my appointment by e-mail and she stopped me right there, she said they hadn&#8217;t bothered it check it for appointments. Now she didn&#8217;t know how long ago I had e-mailed in and seemed almost oblivious that this was an option and stated she could make an appointment for Feb. 24.<\/p>\n<p>Now, this is a rude method to treat someone who had made reservations in the proper fashion and was not informed in any way or shape that this was an issue. This is 2008 and some people like myself prefer to use e-mail since it&#8217;s been a primary communication tool for me since 1994. I am an able-bodied person with no disabilities, but giving the option for the e-mail to make an appointment and then not validating and accepting that method may be an issue for individuals with disabilities. A growing portion of Americans is now using e-mail in venues where available instead of relying on the old Teletext system. If someone with disabilities had attempted to contact the Ashland Humane society in the fashion that I did and received the same response, it may open it up for legal issues on The Americans with Disabilities Act.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying any of this issue was your fault and hold the Rascal Unit blameless in this regard. What I do insist on to save others the future is to verify your partners actually check and accept appointments by e-mail if they say they are going to. Beyond that, I must suggest you remove the e-mail address for the Ashland Humane Society as a method for contacting them.<\/p>\n<p>Sincerely<\/p>\n<p>Creeva (ok I left my real name and full address)<\/p>\n<p>Now like I said in the e-mail I don&#8217;t hold the Rascal Unit the responsibility of the partners, I do however insist they require a certain degree of responsiveness from those that do business with them. I do know some individuals would hold Rascal Unit responsible since technically the appointment was with them. I say they are blameless and have to put a certain degree of trust in their partners.<\/p>\n<p>This is 2008 and companies should at least be able to check their e-mail on a daily basis, whether they be a non-profit or for-profit business. These entities need to understand that in the current time that e-mail and websites are important communications tools for them and without utilizing these technologies, they are going to be left behind and lost.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update 02\/07\/2008- Ashland Humane Society Responds to My Blog Post<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now you may at first wonder why I would say a humane society has poor service.
