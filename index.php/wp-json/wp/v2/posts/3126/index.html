There was a thread about the teacher strike going on in town. I don&#8217;t really self promote by going and saying hey read <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\">my site<\/a> here and there around the net, but I did leave a post in the thread stating:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I rarely post here &#8211; rarely read it also &#8211; but today boredom struck &#8211; I agree with the parent of this thread &#8211; ironically a few weeks ago I actually wrote on my blog on this subject here: <a href=\"..\/2008\/07\/28\/teachers-on-strike-in-my-hometown\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/2008\/07\/28\/teachers-on-strike-in-my-hometown\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>That aside &#8211; I&#8217;ll be very happen when teaching becomes a non-union position.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Though it was in general to a thread a user named Homersazdoh wrote this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Where do you people get off thinking all the teachers are members of the peace corp.? They have every right to try and get more money just like everyone else. If you&#8217;re so concerned with the quality of teacher, then you want the best package to draw the best talent.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>My next response was:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The problem is under a contract scenario with unions or large groups of employees you need to pander to the lowest common denominator &#8211; this means that better teachers are going to make less because the large number of average or below average teachers will bring them down.<\/p>\n<p>But I&#8217;ve recently had siblings go through the vermilion school system (some still going, I graduated in &#8217;94) &#8211; over time the quality has only gotten worse, the education is not as werll rounded due to block scheduling, more and more restrictions on individuality, and the lack of money being poured into the system that has nothing to do with teacher wages.<\/p>\n<p>Oh well, I&#8217;ll drop out of this conversation, my child is probably going to be home schooled.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This is what I got from Scott:<\/p>\n<div>\n<div style=\"width: 90%; text-align: left;\">\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">Quote:<\/div>\n<div style=\"padding: 6px; border: 1px inset solid solid inset -moz-use-text-color #e8e8e8 #e8e8e8 -moz-use-text-color;\">my child is probably going to be home schooled.<\/div>\n<p>Awesome. Raise a social misfit that will have a complete inability to function in a competitive work environment. Good job.<\/p>\n<p>You people in Vermilion are the cheapest most out of touch jerks ever.

I figured I would give you some back story to what inspired this post. <a href=\"http:\/\/xielanthia.com\">Xie<\/a> and I have had many disagreements about public schools versus home schooling, she wasn&#8217;t always homeschooled so she has the advantage of first hand experience on both sides of the coin. She is also one of the most intelligent (and quiet) people I know. I had a good experience with public schools, she did not.<\/p>\n<p>However with the random inspections, school uniforms, the crushing of individuality, and the loss of personal liberties that kids go through today to &#8220;make them better citizens&#8221; and to &#8220;keep them safe&#8221;, has made me think twice on sending my child to public schools. My argument in the past was the social aspect and the ability work with and meet people. The competiviness of school was never a selling point for me. Heck the overly competitive people were the ones that made my life hell in school and were the super jocks, the bullies that had something to prove, or the grade whores who thought straight A&#8217;s would give them the good life when they graduated.<\/p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t a straight A student, nor did I try to be. When I was in elementary school I was on the honor role and merit role all the time, so what? My parents then changed schools on me and I then almost failed fifth grade. My wife says I don&#8217;t respond well to change and I&#8217;m better with routine. This is obvious when I went from good grades in a competitive private school moving to a sub par public school. I should have excelled from an academic perspective, but I didn&#8217;t. I was a fish out of water.<\/p>\n<p>The same thing happened two years later when we moved to Vermilion. At one point my father stated the best thing he could at me to alleviate my stress and to ease his concern of his son failing a grade. He said that he would be fine if I was a C student. This was all I needed to alleviate the strain. I high school I only failed two classes, Spanish 1 and Algebra 2. I did maintain a C average throughout school. I was so much a C student that I graduated around 100th in a class of 250ish. This didn&#8217;t stop me from going anywhere. I managed to get into a good private college (which I then proceeded to fail out, but that was from lack of wanting to go to class).<\/p>\n<p>Was I really a C student? Not really. I could have easily made honor roll, I just didn&#8217;t like homework. I scored in the top 10% in the nation on my ACTs and in the top 1% on my PRE-SATs, I&#8217;m sure this helped me to get in college. I just wanted to take the tests to prove I knew what I was talking about, the busy work held no interest for me. The only competition I really participated in school was who could hit the highest trumpet note.<\/p>\n<p>Now I have a good job. There are articles kicking around the Internet about why <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB121858688764535107.html\">going college is a waste of time and money<\/a> these days. I don&#8217;t feel I&#8217;ve lost out on an education. Life is about learning and loving to learn. To build upon what you have learned already and never stop growing. Why would I put my child in the bad aspects of that, pointing out that my child would not be competitive because he may not go to public school is moronic. Also when I saw the college valedictorian delivering pizzas when I was making 35k a year 9 years ago made a big impact on me.<\/p>\n<p>I think that traditional schooling leads to more socialization and more social activities then traditional schooling, however saying I need to send my kid to traditional schooling for him to remain competitive? That&#8217;s moronic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Picture from here<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here Yesterday I wandered into a forum that contains random population members from my ex-hometown.
