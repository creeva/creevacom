The ongoing issue I was having the past 6 weeks was that it would still connect but it stopped passing data. I knew it wasn&#8217;t my palm since my wife was having the same issue.<\/p>\n<p>I kept meaning to get to this but it was a low priority for the most part &#8211; and the moments when it was a high priority I had no internet connection I could get on via another device to troubleshoot and fix it.<\/p>\n<p>Theoretically, the way I had done should have worked according to the documentation online. However, since this is a kind of niche use the documentation may not be up to date and some people may have already known the workaround.<\/p>\n<p>Since fighting this issue and making it a PITA to track down and troubleshoot I wanted to post the answer so some other hapless soul doesn&#8217;t have to endure the pain of fixing it.<\/p>\n<p>I managed to get the following information from <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.howardforums.com\/index.php\/T-Mobile_Data#T-Mobile_WAP_Settings\" class=\"broken_link\">this site<\/a>:<\/p>\n<pre>Connection Name: tzones Data bearer: Packet data Access point name: wap.voicestream.com User name: N\/A Password: N\/A Authentication: Normal Homepage: <a class=\"external free\" title=\"http:\/\/wap.myvoicestream.com\" href=\"http:\/\/wap.myvoicestream.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/wap.myvoicestream.com<\/a> Advanced Settings (Handsets not equiped with <a class=\"external text\" title=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wap#WAP_2.0\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wap#WAP_2.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">WAP 2.0<\/a> may skip this section) Proxy serv address: 216.155.165.050 Proxy port number: 8080<\/pre>\n<p>So I enter the proxy server into my PDA&#8217;s browser and it now works. As I said according to the next article for straight-through non-wap traffic this shouldn&#8217;t be required &#8211; so more work is possible getting the laptop to connect (haven&#8217;t tried that either but will tonight&#8230;.maybe).<\/p>\n<p>Another thing I&#8217;m going to track down since I can&#8217;t host my own server is seeing if I can set up my PDA to use another proxy other than t-mobiles (curse Verizon for not allowing servers &#8211; btw they balked at me because I wanted a business class DSL so I could host and I gave up after trying to explain it for 3 hours &#8211; the loss of being able to VPN home is not worth the pain of enduring idiot questions like &#8220;why would you have a business class connection at a residential address&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>On a side note to show how much I use my cell phone for calls these days now that I&#8217;m no longer a consultant, my cell phone had been missing for a week. I had checked online and there was no unusual activity so I hadn&#8217;t left it in public or had it stolen. So every now and again over the last week, I was tearing up cushions and putting them back &#8211; only to repeat the routine a day or two later. Crawling on the floor to search the nooks and crannies of couches and cars. Finally last night out of the corner of my eye I saw it &#8211; it had stayed hidden for a week under a receipt on the coffee table.<\/p>\n<p>AARRRGGGG<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When I first go my RAZR 3 months ago from t-mobile I managed to track down online how to pair it to my palm TX.
