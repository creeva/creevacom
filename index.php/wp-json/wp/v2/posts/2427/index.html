Whatever you do positively or negatively affects your brand in tremendous ways. It also affects your SEO in a way also, but I&#8217;ll get to that toward the end. You have to decide how you want yourself as a blogger to be perceived. If you want a spam blog that may or may not generate a ton of money please stop now because some of the things I&#8217;m going to explain are just going to out you quicker to the general population.<\/p>\n<p>You as a blogger are the primary asset for your brand, that being said if you have a collaborative blog, that blog in itself is a brand name and the authors are their own brand names. If you are insightful, engaging, humorous, or interesting you can gain an audience. The audience you wish to reach depends on yourself. The blog I&#8217;m going to use for example is my personal blog at <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\">localhost\/wordpress<\/a>. This blog is the core of my internet persona (ironically not really the core of my journey to getting paid but my core nonetheless). Where ever I post across the blog-o-verse I cross-post the article to my home blog. This allows ease of backup and exposure to the few people that take interest in me.<\/p>\n<p>For those that don&#8217;t care about the fluff or personal lamenting, I have the on-topic blogs I work on (<a href=\"http:\/\/journeytogetpaid.com\" class=\"broken_link\">journeytogetpaid.com<\/a>) this immediately separates readers from the two brands I wish to confer on to them, the brand of <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\">myself as a blogger<\/a> compared to the brand of <a href=\"http:\/\/journeytogetpaid.com\" class=\"broken_link\">one of the blogs that I write<\/a>. This allows for a more personal dynamic of engagement between yourself and your readers. You should always be personal &#8211; but I&#8217;ll never get asked if my cat is feeling better at journeytogetpaid.com.<\/p>\n<p>Honing into the fact that you are your own brand management (<a href=\"http:\/\/scobleizer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scobel<\/a> is the king of self-brand management) you have to target your own peer group. This includes allowing other methods for readers and friends to contact you. This gives multiple levels of engagement where you still have some control over the boundaries. I went from google telling me &#8220;did you mean cirev?&#8221; when I did a search for creeva &#8211; to the fact now that I have over 6k hits on that name. Is that good? Well, my friends can find me through all the various services I use &#8211; or they can engage me at my home blog with aggregates the data from far and wide.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take this story I&#8217;m writing right now. When this is published it will be published on journeytogetpaid.com and crossposted to <a href=\"http:\/\/journeytogetpaid.blogspot.com\">journeytogetpaid.blogspot.com<\/a> (google crawls itself first hence the Blogspot mirror) and localhost\/WordPress. You may think that is the end of i, but far from it. At localhost\/WordPress I allow my friends to read me from whatever social network they use and wish to follow me on. Here is a run down of what happens when this story is crossposted and published over at localhost\/WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>localhost\/WordPress crossposts to the following sites<\/p>\n<p>My <a href=\"http:\/\/creeva.livejournal.com\">livejournal<\/a> which in turn syncs with my <a href=\"http:\/\/dandelife.com\/creeva\" class=\"broken_link\">dandelife account<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/creeva.vox.com\" class=\"broken_link\">My Vox<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/creeva.spaces.live.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">My MSN Spaces<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/creeva.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My Old Blogspot Site<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/creeva.xanga.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My Xanga Site<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It also through RSS feeds goes to these sites:<\/p>\n<p>Sends an alert to <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/creeva\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">my twitter readers<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sends a notification as a blog entry into my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/creeva\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">myspace blog<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cross posts into my Facebook profile<\/p>\n<p>Archives as a line in <a href=\"http:\/\/creeva.tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">my old tumblr accoun<\/a>t that I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do with<\/p>\n<p>Archives to my <a href=\"http:\/\/creeva.suprglu.com\" class=\"broken_link\">old suprglu account<\/a> that I used to use as my lifestream.<\/p>\n<p>Theoretically, before anyone reads this article it will be published in 13 places. This is also before the spammers get to it and repurpose it for their own means. My wife says she is going to blame me when the internet crashes. Behind the scenes, there is even a bit more that goes on, but that really isn&#8217;t publicly accessible since it has nothing to do with branding.<\/p>\n<p>Why do I do this?<\/p>\n<p>Different people know me from different places, but my writing is all me and I wish to share that with all of them. I&#8217;m not as bad as some. I actually at one point crossposted every song I listen to, thankfully I&#8217;m more selective at what I crosspost at this time. It&#8217;s more relevant to what is going on and family and friends can have different levels of engagement with m.<\/p>\n<p>I also use many activity-specific type sites like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/creeva\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">flickr<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/digg.com\/users\/creeva\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"broken_link\">digg<\/a> which I don&#8217;t cross-post to but have a level of engagement with other users there. But of course, my profile links back to my main site. Whenever I crosspost I also include links back to where the article was originally published at. This allows readers to trace back and find the information at the correct source. I use no subterfuge or magic mirrors to hide what I&#8217;m doing. It&#8217;s all plain as day.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing this is my journey to get paid I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re wondering how I can monetize all these sources.<\/p>\n<p>In short &#8211; I can&#8217;t, but pass the message and advertise myself to those that show interest hopefully having them trace back to the original article. If not I have methods of importing comments from these diverse locations into localhost\/WordPress. So if you leave a comment on my Facebook account or my Flickr account it gets pulled back into localhost\/WordPress. This allows full engagement with my readers and what they have to say.<\/p>\n<p>So all I have to do to be popular is push myself out everywhere at once?<\/p>\n<p>No, if you are not interested and don&#8217;t have any friends now, propagating your information will not help you get any more. If you are not clear on your intentions or your readers think you are being shady it can backfire on you. It can get you on the dreaded spammer list in people&#8217;s minds. Yes, I could theoretically start 2000 Blogspot domains and crosspost to all of them, but I don&#8217;t. I just maintain the links I already have in the communities where I already exist. I&#8217;ll migrate the method in which I interact with a service by sourcing material from the one I primarily use, but I don&#8217;t abandon the community I left behind.<\/p>\n<p>This of course in some ways hurts me from a monetary perspective &#8211; but my branding gets better and recognition improves. You will always have to write something people wish to read if you want to gain a steady and growing following instead of single SEO tricks to get people to click links without giving them any substance (that&#8217;s cheating). Work on your own writing and enhance the communities around you, this is what gives you a following and brand loyalty.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Journey To Get Paid wants to bring you into the world of brand management.
