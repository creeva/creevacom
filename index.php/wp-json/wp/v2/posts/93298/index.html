I started the stream because it would take all the events I did in a single day and save them in a tidy WordPress blog post. I would then have something to reference for any given day. The autoposting stopped working somewhere around two years ago.<\/p>\n<p>I kept the lifestream up and I would see the occasional hit on the site. Most came from my articles I did write about lifestreaming, but some were just curious observers. I adjusted it so I received a daily email synopsis of what I did during the day, but it stopped being a public post. It was something I was archiving and keeping so my son could have a record (good or bad) of his father.<\/p>\n<p>I archive everything to email. I have a glut of information and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I&#8217;m in the top 1% of email box sizes. I hoard my words and actions in hopes that someday they will be of interest to someone. I&#8217;m also very efficient and organized. So while I may have a huge archive, I&#8217;m normally sitting at around five messages in my inbox at any given time.<\/p>\n<p>Recently I have discovered a method to take all this information I have been attempting to lifestream and placed it into Google Calendar. With this I no longer need custom phone apps to view the stream. I don&#8217;t have to overstress my hosting provider with all the cron jobs and PHP calls. It just works and shows up in proper chronological order (<em>for the most part<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>So to make my site more efficient I have removed the lifestream, that you probably never paid attention to anyways. The benefit is that the site might be a bit faster. The database will be a quite a bit leaner. My life is more organized.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For years I ran a lifestream on my site.
