In the interim, I thought I would offer up some phone service solutions for the rest of your voip technology habit<\/p>\n<p>Free 1-800 phone calls to any listed number. Here is the essence f this trick &#8211; call the phone number 1-800-FREE411 &#8211; this takes you to an ad-supported 411 service. After you dial the 800 number and listen to the ad it then takes you to directory service &#8211; you put in the customer you wish to contact and it then connects you for free. Added bonus to this &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.skype.com\/\">Skype<\/a> allows you to call 800 numbers free even if you are not subscribed to SkypeOut. So if you have a microphone on your computer you can call anyone as long as they are not unlisted for free.<\/p>\n<p>Free International calls &#8211; there are supposedly 2 ways (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.techcrunch.com\/2007\/01\/12\/complicated-laws-free-calls\/\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yak4ever.com\/\">here<\/a>) to do this. Both use the same service\u00a0and this is a way for your cell phone subscribers to get around international fees on the go.<\/p>\n<p>Using your GrandCentral number to <a href=\"http:\/\/nicklog.com\/post\/5190286\">receive text messages<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Getting GrandCentral on your cellphones web browser by going to this site in your cell phone&#8217;s browser. If your cell phone can play MP3 it is able to play your messages from the site itself.<\/p>\n<p>If you have the 5 Faves plan from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tmobile.com\/\">t-mobile<\/a> and don&#8217;t care about caller ID from the true caller to GrandCentral here is a neat trick to lowering your monthly bill.<\/p>\n<p>Here is another service not as complete as GrandCentral that allows you a free voicemail box. It is run by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netzero.com\/\">netzero<\/a>. Essentially all this is good for on the free side is the ability to have a disposable VM box.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.aimphoneline.com\/\">Another competitor offers free incoming calls to AIM<\/a> &#8211; maybe add this number to your GrandCentral list?<\/p>\n<p>And in closing, we&#8217;ll end with another great Google service &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/labs.google.com\/goog411\/\">Goog411.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>OK, I managed to do more than a triple &#8211; but I hope some of these tricks might help you out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Well recently getting a GrandCentral invite I was planning on writing up a review &#8211; this is more likely to come tomorrow.
