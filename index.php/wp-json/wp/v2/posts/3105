I&#8217;m assuming on the first day of kindergarten I came home and didn&#8217;t like it very much. On the second day however it was a different story. I remember my mother driving me to school and parking up near the door. For some reason, I was late to school (on my second day ever &#8211; thanks mom), and I didn&#8217;t want to go in. I was kicking and screaming and refusing to leave the car.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, my mother went in to get the teacher to help remove me from the car. Even my five-year-old mind realized that though our house was only a half mile up the road I couldn&#8217;t walk it by myself because of traffic (I rationalized this at 5 yet didn&#8217;t know my address until fifth grade &#8211; go figure). Since I couldn&#8217;t walk home and I didn&#8217;t want to go to school what was I going to do? I decided hiding was the best scenario (I&#8217;ve always been excellent at hiding). First I looked at the bushes and realized they wouldn&#8217;t provide adequate cover. Then my eye glanced towards the double doors. They were propped open to gain the benefit of the warm outdoors. I dove quickly out of the car and rushed behind the double doors.<\/p>\n<p>A few seconds later the teacher and my mother come outside to remove me from the family car. At first, my mother freaked out since I wasn&#8217;t in the car, then they started to look for me. I seem to remember them taking a couple of minutes to look for me, and eventually, they found me. They attempted to drag me out from behind the door, but I grabbed the door and they pulled me vertically. Eventually, they got me free and dragged me to the door of the classroom. I was screaming, crying, and clawing to get away the whole way there. I walked in all stoic and straight-faced, though I&#8217;m sure my face was tear-stained and flushed.<\/p>\n<p>It seems that even at that young age, after one day I realized how messed up our education system was and didn&#8217;t want to go back. I think if it hadn&#8217;t been so exposed and out of the open I may have made the break for the half-mile walk home. I obviously had some strange and much older rational than my years at such a young age.<\/p>\n<p>I guess I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised when my wife still thinks I can be a sneaky bastard sometimes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here I would write about the first day of kindergarten, except I don&#8217;t remember that.
