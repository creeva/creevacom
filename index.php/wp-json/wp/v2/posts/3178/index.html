(If there are any alumni on secondary tiered social networks I will find you eventually.) Traditionally I have always held a strong hatred towards Myspace particularly. My most commented line about the site has been &#8220;Myspace, making the Web 2.0 look like the web from 1996). Myspace has gotten better, but it is still downright ugly, clunky, and mostly a walled garden. I don&#8217;t like it &#8211; and no recent usage hasn&#8217;t endeared me to it.<\/p>\n<p>I now have about 8 pages of email communication on Myspace (2 pages on Facebook) &#8211; that I have no method of saving, archiving, and retaining. Do you know how much I hate that? I&#8217;m someone who wants to save all his data forever, and thanks to the walled garden scenario it&#8217;s trapped. Maybe I&#8217;ll get lucky and it will eventually be freed.<\/p>\n<p>On the plus side, my blog has been getting more hits, so I can&#8217;t complain about that. Exposure the whole yadda yadda about getting yourself out there, I&#8217;m doing it. I have been doing it for a while but lately actually actively doing it.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see, maybe Myspace will still self implode and take out the west coast. If it takes out the whole west coast we will know never to make such a monstrosity again.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture from here Between setting up the blogs, playing the Myspace game Heroes, and tracking down alumni for band on Facebook and Myspace, I&#8217;ve spent a huge chunk of time on the social networking sites &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":97597,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3178"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3178"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3178\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/97597"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3178"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3178"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3178"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
