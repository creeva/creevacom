He was a nice guy that was always there and willing to help you out. He was someone with whom I could discuss cars. While his loss will be missed, most people here are taking it harder than I am. After being a pallbearer for my best friend, I&#8217;m not sure I could get upset with the loss of a co-worker\/casual friend the same way ever again.<\/p>\n<p>When I was working for tech support at Symantec we once had someone pass away in their cubicle. It was almost surreal after the fact. I knew who the guy was but he wasn&#8217;t on my team so I didn&#8217;t really talk to him. But from my understanding, he was sitting there for over an hour hunched over and people thought he was asleep. This was about 1 cubicle row over from me. It was odd but not upsetting to me.<\/p>\n<p>I can say for my co-worker that passed away last night, that I&#8217;m happy he was away from the office and hopefully passed away in his sleep. The last conversation we had was about Dodge cars made in the &#8217;60s and 70&#8217;s &#8211; he also talked about how he used to tour the strip in his hometown for girls when he was a teenager driving these cars that were destined to be the classic iconography of the American automobile.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, now he is sitting again in his 1969 Dodge Charger that he owned in his younger years and cruising that same strip. Reliving the happiest moments of his life. He will be missed and honored.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of my co-workers passed away in his sleep last night.
