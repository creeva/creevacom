They are enclosed, so all illumination is artificial, and most use special lighting to achieve theatrical effects. Selective use of darkness helps hide the ride mechanisms and increase the visual drama of the experience. Disney&#8217;s It&#8217;s a Small World is an example of a brightly lit dark ride.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Dark rides used to be very popular in the United States, unfortunately very few exist outside of Disney these days. \u00a0The only other dark ride that I rode at Cedar Point was Earthquake. \u00a0 That was removed in the 1980&#8217;s. \u00a0 If you search Google there are many sites dedicated to dark rides. \u00a0 There are also groups that are as fanatic about dark rides as some people are with roller coaster.<\/p>\n<p>The Pirate Ride was built in 1960 at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dafe.org\/articles\/parks\/freedomland.html\">Freedomland, USA<\/a> a theme park in New York. \u00a0It was purchased and relocated to Cedar Point in 1966. \u00a0 Once at Cedar Point it became a fixture until it&#8217;s removal in 1996. \u00a0 In the eighties there was water around the outdoor pirate ship. \u00a0Sometime in the late eighties or early nineties it was filled and just normal concrete and landscaping was around the structure.<\/p>\n<p>In my early twenties I was heavy into the haunted house group in my home town. \u00a0 I can tell you that almost everyone in that group mourned the loss when it was gone. \u00a0 This was pre-&#8220;everyone on the Internet&#8221; so it started as rumor and made it to sad fact in 1997 when it was no longer open in the park. \u00a0 \u00a0I can say that this was my third favorite ride to ever exist in the park. \u00a0 The first is the Paddlewheel. \u00a0 The second is the Gemini.<\/p>\n<p>When I was a kid I loved climbing up on the mock pirate ship in front of the ride and pretending that I was a pirate. \u00a0 It was one of the greatest things at five or six years old when you are pretending to blow other Cedar Point guests off the face of the planet. \u00a0 I was steering the ship on the high seas and loving it. \u00a0 This was all before Jack Sparrow made being a pirate cool.<\/p>\n<p>Because only a maximum of four people could ride in each car there was almost always a bit of a line. \u00a0 The ride was also packed when it was raining. \u00a0When it was hot the inside of the ride was a bit cool. \u00a0 All around it was relaxing and as far as I remember almost always\u00a0regularly\u00a0in use.<\/p>\n<p>I did mention that there was only four people per car. \u00a0 They were all the\u00a0same and pirate ship themed. \u00a0Here is a picture i found one of the cars:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image from here.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It had that nice skull on the front. \u00a0 If you had\u00a0souvenirs or bags they slid perfectly on the back of the car. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Seriously these the best designed ride car of anything they had in the park. \u00a0 It was easy to get in and out of. \u00a0 No pesky seat belts to worry about. \u00a0 It was just right.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Pirate Ride Mural \u00a0from boarding area &#8211; from this thread (click for larger version).<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I can say that I did break the rules with this ride. \u00a0 I did touch a few attractions showing off during the ride. \u00a0 I believe I have stood up on the ride. \u00a0 We had a chinese in fire drill on the ride once with the car behind us. \u00a0 I did have &#8220;make out&#8221; session on the ride. \u00a0I did not actually smoke on this ride (<em>seriously this time<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>How we got away with all that, I&#8217;m unsure. \u00a0There were camera&#8217;s everywhere in that ride. \u00a0Maybe the operators were just asleep at the wheel. \u00a0 We just got more and more brazen on what we did. \u00a0We also knew that when we saw the skeleton at the end we had to put on our little angel halos.<\/p>\n<p>What was terrible is when the ride was really busy (such as when it was raining), because you had to ride to strangers if there was only two people in your party. \u00a0 When this happened we also placed our halos on. \u00a0 Though I think one of the chinese fire drills we did was with complete strangers. \u00a0 You just had to feel the people out. \u00a0 We never wanted to make our good time interfere and give anyone else a bad time.<\/p>\n<p>Surprisingly enough I did find a video ride through of the Pirate Ride. \u00a0 Once again it is a dark ride, so we forgive any quality issues. \u00a0 We are just happy to have this little memory.<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center>For those interested in reading more about the Pirate Ride, I guess it inspired the Pirate&#8217;s of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland.
