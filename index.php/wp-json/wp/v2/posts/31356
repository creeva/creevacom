21209- size 1979536 KB &#8211; this is after spam filtering, deduplication, and removing and all mailing list emails&#8230;..<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So over the last year I have saved just around 2GB of data.\u00a0\u00a0 You can understand why I can&#8217;t throw it into a single inbox.\u00a0\u00a0 I average around 1.5k-2k emails a month I save.\u00a0 This makes it easy to add up the sizes and get a total.\u00a0\u00a0 I haven&#8217;t looked at how many emails I have sent for two reasons.\u00a0\u00a0 The first is I have a few automated emails that are collections of RSS feeds that I generate and save to email (my tweets, Facebook updates, etc.) &#8211; so the number count is not going to be correct without a bit of digging.\u00a0\u00a0 The other reason is I&#8217;m scared &#8211; I don&#8217;t really want to know how many emails I have written.<\/p>\n<p>Moving on&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>I have consolidated a few of my sets on Flickr by removing sets for photos taken a certain day.\u00a0\u00a0 For example if I went to the park of May 5 &#8211; I would create a set named 05-05-10.\u00a0 I would then upload all the pictures to the set.\u00a0 That was all fine and dandy until I reached the point that I&#8217;m dealing with hundreds of sets.\u00a0\u00a0 These hundreds of sets made it even harder to use third-party tools &#8211; it was also extraneous information.\u00a0 The photos already included the meta-data of when they were taken, so I really had no reason to narrow it down into those sets for organization.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I moved all those sets into the same Year &#8211; Month arrangement I did with my email.\u00a0 I made a collection of each year 2006-2011.\u00a0 Under each collection there are twelve sets &#8211; January 2010, February 2010, etc&#8230;). \u00a0 I managed to combine about 300 sets into 60 so far.<\/p>\n<p>I still have other sets outside of these, but I still need to go through and clean up meta data.\u00a0 I need to tag photos.\u00a0 I need to properly title photos.\u00a0\u00a0 I just need to dig in more and organize.\u00a0 I&#8217;m sure you can understand how scary of prospect that is.\u00a0 I&#8217;m looking at 15k photos.\u00a0 It will take me weeks, but i need to dig through a little at a time.\u00a0 Heck I&#8217;m pushing 4k of pictures that include my son alone.<\/p>\n<p>Once everything is nice and organized I plan on using <a href=\"http:\/\/clipyourphotos.com\/bulkr\">Bulkr<\/a> to download all the photos.\u00a0\u00a0 Then I&#8217;ll have an organized local copy.\u00a0\u00a0 Then at the end of each month after all the photos are uploaded I can just re-run Bulkr\u00a0and update my local cache.<\/p>\n<p>The problem really isn&#8217;t staying organized, the problem is keeping organized by staying on top of all of this data.\u00a0\u00a0 Once I have the process in place it should all be a piece of cake.\u00a0\u00a0 Email has been organized and archived like clockwork for months now and it is fabulous.\u00a0\u00a0 Everything is easier to find and reference.\u00a0\u00a0 The next part of this I&#8217;ll give you an update on how the pictures are going and document organization.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I did the first part of &#8220;Personal Data Curation&#8221;
