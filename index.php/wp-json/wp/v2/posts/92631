\u00a0Why are there so many?<\/p>\n<p>We will start on the low hanging fruit. \u00a0 Kindergarten graduation is a nice beginning for kids. \u00a0In the past it allowed them to start their regular school career and end it with a diploma. \u00a0 It is something for parents to cherish and look back upon at high school graduation. \u00a0 As a father I understand this one. \u00a0It could be argued that it is unnecessary, but it brings people together to the celebration that the children are moving forward and no longer are the toddlers we still see them as.<\/p>\n<p>If that was the only other graduation I don&#8217;t think I would even bother with this post. \u00a0 However, watching Facebook, there is also a 5th grade graduation. \u00a0 I&#8217;m sure this is for the school systems with a middle school. \u00a0 So in theory it would be a graduation because you are leaving an intermediate school.<\/p>\n<p>I have also seen 8th grade graduations. \u00a0I&#8217;m assuming this is the leaving of the junior high \/ middle school and entering into high school. \u00a0 There is trauma enough switching schools, but now we put them on a display and say &#8220;It was fun. \u00a0See you later!&#8221; \u00a0 I didn&#8217;t like ceremonies like this when I was a kid, but I would tolerate them. \u00a0 I am assuming for some kids it was agonizing.<\/p>\n<p>Those are what I&#8217;ve seen. \u00a0 I am going to make some assumptions. \u00a0 With school districts that have a proper junior high (7th and 8th grades), is there a 6th grade graduation? \u00a0 We didn&#8217;t have that when I lived in Elyria and was entering 7th. \u00a0 It is a bit to foreign to me.<\/p>\n<p>We moved to Vermilion the summer before my 7th grade year. \u00a0 This school district had four schools that children progressed through. \u00a0 South Street Elementary School handled kindergarten until 2nd grade I believe. \u00a0 Vermilion Intermediate School handled 3rd through 5th grade. \u00a0 Sailorway Middle School handled 6th through 8th grade. \u00a0 Vermilion High School handled freshmen through seniors. \u00a0 The schools have since consolidated a bit.<\/p>\n<p>Working off the theory that we give kids a graduation between schools, how many is that? \u00a0Kindergarten, 2nd grade, 5th grade, 8th grade, and senior year combined gives us five graduations. \u00a0I&#8217;m happy I only had to go through two. \u00a0 If this is part of the every kid get an achievement mentality, what about the 1st, 6th, 7th, freshmen, sophomores, and juniors? \u00a0 Is it they are not switching schools? \u00a0Do they not get a celebration? \u00a0How many graduations are too many? \u00a0How many are too few?<\/p>\n<p>Like I said, I had a kindergarten and a high school graduation. \u00a0Xie remembers having a 5th grade. \u00a0 I&#8217;m just confused on how it all spiraled out that kids need a diploma for every grade. \u00a0 Granted, in thirty-years, maybe my son will be writing that 1st grade graduations are the new things and he doesn&#8217;t understand that.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I know I am going to come off as a grumpy old man. \u00a0It is what it is. \u00a0 We are flush in the middle of graduation season. \u00a0 Kids are all excited they are &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":92633,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/92631"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=92631"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/92631\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/92633"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=92631"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=92631"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=92631"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
