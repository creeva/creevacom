I&#8217;m a bit easier on it now. Shortly after writing that piece, we stopped using Roku. My jailbroken Apple TV2 ruled the roost on the TV, and I wasn&#8217;t using the Roku to watch Amazon Prime (<em>the reason we purchased it<\/em>). We did, however, purchase a new TV earlier this month. This meant we once again had a TV in our bedroom. The ATV2 stayed downstairs, so it was time to give the Roku another chance.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I looked for was to see if anyone had ported XBMC to the Roku yet. It seems that it isn&#8217;t a high priority. I use XBMC for all my ripped DVDs and never watch off of a physical one. Plex (<em>an offshoot of XBMC<\/em>) did create a Roku channel. So once I installed the Plex server on my desktop I was able to stream all my media to the upstairs TV.<\/p>\n<p>Plex can change resolutions and downgrade the video if the Roku can&#8217;t handle it. This allows it to play videos that my ATV2 chokes on. The Plex interface is much laggier than XBMC though. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a problem with the Roku hardware versus ATV2 or poor programming for the channel. Once it get&#8217;s going, it works beautifully.<\/p>\n<p>The main issue I have is not the fault of the device. I am so used to using the Apple Remote app on my phone that I attempt to use that every night with a Roku. I&#8217;m sure more than once I have started a TV show or moved downstairs while I was wondering why it wasn&#8217;t working. I then will switch to the Roku app and it works great. Once, again this is just my user error.<\/p>\n<p>I would never recommend a Roku for a primary viewing box. I love my ATV2 way too much to surrender it. I&#8217;ll be upgrading to the ATV3 once a jailbreak is available and I can run XBMC on it. Then the Roku might actually be relegated to being a paperweight again. Then again I&#8217;ve always wanted to watch The West Wing and that&#8217;s on Amazon Prime now&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, for a secondary device, it works fantastic. It is easier to use for video streaming than the PlayStation 3. If it&#8217;s your only device or if you are not into hacking the nitty-gritty &#8211; it will be perfectly serviceable.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A few months ago I wrote about my initial reactions to my Roku box.
