Unfortunately (or likely, fortunately) most people have likely never heard of it. This title is <em>Deadly Duck<\/em>. I had to use the Atari image above because I can&#8217;t seem to find the Vic-20 box art.<\/p> <p>Deadly Duck was released for the Atari 2600 originally but was later ported to the Commodore Vic-20. Looking around online there is little information about this game, so I&#8217;m going to fill you with all I know. Let&#8217;s start with how I managed to come across this title originally.<\/p> <p>Back in early 1980-something, I begged my parents for an Atari 2600. &nbsp; Even in my elementary school years I was obsessed with video games. &nbsp;Unfortunately then only access I had to them was at the arcade. &nbsp; My father thought video games were just a waste of time, so he wasn&#8217;t going to get me a console. &nbsp; &nbsp;However, at some point my parents bought into the whole &#8220;your child needs a computer to be apart of the revolution&#8221;. &nbsp; &nbsp;One day they came home with a Commodore Vic-20 and hooked it up to the TV. &nbsp; My digital revolution was getting started.<\/p> <p>We followed the manual and did a bit of the programming examples offered. This taught me one thing that I still follow to this day, I did not want to be a programmer. While I finally had a computer and a couple of games &#8211; in the long run, it backfired on me. Even a decade later when I wanted a new computer to play with new games, the answer was you already have one. You win some and you lose some. We&#8217;ll just leave it that it didn&#8217;t get much use after I purchased an NES when I was 12.<\/p> <p>Because Vic-20 software was harder to find than something like Commodore 64 or Apple II, I begged every single time I saw compatible software. &nbsp; The best place to find titles for me was Value City in Elyria, OH. &nbsp; They had a very small computer section, but they carried Vic-20 titles. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure that <em>Deadly Duck<\/em> was purchased there. &nbsp; Hidden under a 6-8 foot wide glass case that the clerk had to open up.<\/p> <p>Did I know what <em>Deadly Duck<\/em> was? &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp; Did I care? &nbsp;Nope, it was new software in a time where software was scarce . My other choice was to spend 6 hours typing in a game into the Vic-20 for something new to play. &nbsp; Once again this was just reinforcement to never go into programming. &nbsp;Especially since it would be another 3-4 years before we inherited a tape drive that could actually store software on it.<\/p> <p>The <em>Deadly Duck<\/em> cartridge was shaped differently than the standard Commodore cartridges. &nbsp;Commodore didn&#8217;t enforce the licensing that Nintendo would later do, so anyone could make a cartridge in any shape they wanted. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure I noticed this back then, but I don&#8217;t think I really cared or understood it.<\/p> <center><\/center> <p>Deadly Duck was essentially a Space Invaders clone. &nbsp;There was enemies overhead that dropped bricks. &nbsp; If the bricks hit you, you would die. &nbsp; If they landed in the water, they stopped you from going past them. &nbsp;You could shoot the bricks while they were falling and score points, but more than likely you were only shooting them so you wouldn&#8217;t die.<\/p> <p>The game played in a frenzy. It went fast and the game was frantic. I almost think the gameplay video above it has the correct speed. You would think that would have been two fast to be acceptable, but it was. Luckily I also had another space invaders clone called <em>Vic Avenger<\/em>. This was a decent substitute for an actual copy of <em>Space Invaders<\/em>. <em>Deadly Duck<\/em> likely would have just had me pine for more authentic game play to the arcade game it is based on.<\/p> <p>The best part of the game was every time you shot bullets out of duck-bill, a quack sound effect played. &nbsp; Being somewhere between 6-8 years old, this was awesome. I&#8217;m only assuming there are bullets since the cover art. &nbsp;While he&#8217;s an 8-bit blob on-screen the cover art makes him look like some mallard bionic experiment. &nbsp; It&#8217;s was the 80s &#8211; it was all good.<\/p> <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/archer-super-deluxe-competition-joystick-commodore-64-128-amiga-vic-20-12a8-box-8bfc9956bc181f6e5285bd38e4d1876d-1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-95223\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/archer-super-deluxe-competition-joystick-commodore-64-128-amiga-vic-20-12a8-box-8bfc9956bc181f6e5285bd38e4d1876d-1-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/archer-super-deluxe-competition-joystick-commodore-64-128-amiga-vic-20-12a8-box-8bfc9956bc181f6e5285bd38e4d1876d-1.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/figure><\/div> <p>One of the best things though, my parents bought me a decent joystick. &nbsp;It was identical to the one above. &nbsp; They went above and beyond since they skipped the standard Commodore brand joysticks or a compatible Atari 2600 one. &nbsp;I actually miss this joystick. &nbsp; We went on wild romps together &#8211; quacking, shooting bricks, other stuff.<\/p> <p>I actually still own two Vic-20s.
