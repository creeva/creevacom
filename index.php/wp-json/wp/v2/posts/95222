My other choice was to spend 6 hours typing in a game into the Vic-20 for something new to play. &nbsp; Once again this was just reinforcement to never go into programming. &nbsp;Especially since it would be another 3-4 years before we inherited a tape drive that could actually store software on it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Deadly Duck<\/em> cartridge was shaped differently than the standard Commodore cartridges. &nbsp;Commodore didn&#8217;t enforce the licensing that Nintendo would later do, so anyone could make a cartridge in any shape they wanted. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure I noticed this back then, but I don&#8217;t think I really cared or understood it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<center><\/center>\n\n\n\n<p>Deadly Duck was essentially a Space Invaders clone. &nbsp;There was enemies overhead that dropped bricks. &nbsp; If the bricks hit you, you would die. &nbsp; If they landed in the water, they stopped you from going past them. &nbsp;You could shoot the bricks while they were falling and score points, but more than likely you were only shooting them so you wouldn&#8217;t die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The game played in a frenzy. \u00a0 It went fast and the game was frantic. \u00a0 I almost think the gameplay video above it has the correct speed. \u00a0 You would think that would have been two fast to be acceptable, but it was. \u00a0 Luckily I also had another space invaders clone called <em>Vic Avenger<\/em>. \u00a0 This was a decent substitute for an actual copy of <em>Space Invaders<\/em>. \u00a0 <em>Deadly Duck<\/em> likely would have just had me pine for more authentic game play to the arcade game it is based on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part of the game was every time you shot bullets out of duck-bill, a quack sound effect played. &nbsp; Being somewhere between 6-8 years old, this was awesome. I&#8217;m only assuming there are bullets since the cover art. &nbsp;While he&#8217;s an 8-bit blob on-screen the cover art makes him look like some mallard bionic experiment. &nbsp; It&#8217;s was the 80s &#8211; it was all good.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/archer-super-deluxe-competition-joystick-commodore-64-128-amiga-vic-20-12a8-box-8bfc9956bc181f6e5285bd38e4d1876d-1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-95223\" srcset=\"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/archer-super-deluxe-competition-joystick-commodore-64-128-amiga-vic-20-12a8-box-8bfc9956bc181f6e5285bd38e4d1876d-1-225x300.jpg 225w, http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/archer-super-deluxe-competition-joystick-commodore-64-128-amiga-vic-20-12a8-box-8bfc9956bc181f6e5285bd38e4d1876d-1.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>One of the best things though, my parents bought me a decent joystick. &nbsp;It was identical to the one above. &nbsp; They went above and beyond since they skipped the standard Commodore brand joysticks or a compatible Atari 2600 one. &nbsp;I actually miss this joystick. &nbsp; We went on wild romps together &#8211; quacking, shooting bricks, other stuff.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually still own two Vic-20s. \u00a0Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not my original system. \u00a0However, I do have the original box that is over 30 years old. \u00a0 Whenever I see Vic-20&#8217;s for dirt cheap I&#8217;m compelled to pick them up. \u00a0 30 years later I don&#8217;t have a Commodore 64 or an Apple II &#8211; but I have 2 Vic-20s. \u00a0 I must be a masochist.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While in the last couple days, I&#8217;ve visited known properties such as Popeye and Baseball Stars, today I&#8217;m going to go with a game I spent many hours with. \u00a0 Unfortunately (or likely, fortunately) most &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95496,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95222"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95222"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95222\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95496"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95222"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95222"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95222"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
