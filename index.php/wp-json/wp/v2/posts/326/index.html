Getting me back in shape to write the great American novel? At least to the point that I can finish a novel during the national novel-writing month this year.<\/p>\n<p>But yet this blog has become more than that. It has become an extension of myself and my online presence. I&#8217;ve slowly aggregated everything I can find and use online to this central location. This site is pretty much the sum of my digital existence these days.<\/p>\n<p>Sure there are some forums in some places that I post to &#8211; most notably the Star Wars Galaxies forums. But even those start to wane. Lack of time, but not interest keep me from it. I&#8217;ve been busy outside of work with the idea of my business and the work it would take to get that off of the ground.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve done my best to get things done around the house, and I can say I&#8217;ve kept it much tidier than I have in the past &#8211; though that can be because I&#8217;ve stuck my face into the computer much more often than I should.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not even sure I&#8217;m writing this other than it&#8217;s a train of thought kind of thing. The thing that drives you utterly mad if you don&#8217;t finish. The irresistible urge to write sometimes overcomes me and while sometimes I have topics I can fulfill &#8211; the ones that are slowly brooding in my head are not yet ripe enough to come to fruition to be plucked down the keyboard.<\/p>\n<p>I can say I have managed to keep up this blog a lot better in the last few months. Most of this has come from me being able to aggregate all my data here &#8211; but I&#8217;ve already mentioned that and you are bored already.<\/p>\n<p>Well before I put asleep I am signing off. I&#8217;m watching Steve Martin&#8217;s Movie Shopgirl. Talk to you later.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Writing to write. That&#8217;s the point of this blog, isn&#8217;t it?
