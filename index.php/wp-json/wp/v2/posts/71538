I&#8217;m not sure where I stand on this. \u00a0My son is two &#8211; we don&#8217;t watch &#8220;Real TV&#8221; so the only commercials he sees are in the form of Edutainment (Dinosaur Train is an excellent example). \u00a0 He has not advertised cereal or seen kids playing with toys, but he does know who Mickey Mouse is. \u00a0 On that same note, he also knows Darth Vader, Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, etc. \u00a0 That kind of thing happens in a household where both your parents are geeks.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I would censor most comics from my son when he gets to be of age, but realities can change. \u00a0 I wouldn&#8217;t throw him into The Watchmen &#8211; but if he was reading JLA or Iron Man &#8211; comics for teens, I wouldn&#8217;t care. \u00a0 I read &#8220;teen&#8221; comics before I was a teen &#8211; but they also told me I had a college reading level in 5th grade. \u00a0 So if I was in fifth grade and could comprehend reading at an 18-20-year-old level when I was 12 &#8211; that means I wasn&#8217;t limiting myself to reading in my age group. \u00a0 That isn&#8217;t to say that I wasn&#8217;t &#8211; I read anything and everything I could get my hands on. \u00a0I also read mounds and mounds of comic books. \u00a0 If I had my dollar allowance I would beg my mother or my grandmother to take me down to the flea market just so I could get 10 comics for a dollar. \u00a0Most of the time it was Archie and Richie Rich comics because as a kid it was quantity over quality. \u00a0I felt I got my money&#8217;s worth and I loved the stories.<\/p>\n<p>At a young age, I was hooked, but now not so much. \u00a0I do occasionally read comics and I buy comic books a few times a year. \u00a0I don&#8217;t have the time to devote to them now. \u00a0 I have comics buried in the attic that my son will inherit, he&#8217;ll also be loaded with mounds of flea market books as he is interested. \u00a0 He won&#8217;t have that joy of standing by the cash registers at Convenient and begging for a new comic. \u00a0 That era doesn&#8217;t exist. \u00a0Part of it is the times, but it is also the marketing and who comic retailers consider their &#8220;core&#8221; audience.<\/p>\n<p>Please read the link I posted at the begging of this post, it is long &#8211; but fascinating.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I just finished reading a great piece about how comicbook makers are not targeting kids under 12 anymore (read the piece here). \u00a0 I was thinking about this, my greatest diversity of reading comics was &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":102911,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/71538"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=71538"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/71538\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/102911"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=71538"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=71538"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=71538"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
