but painful. \u00a0 I wasn&#8217;t positive what I was going to do with it at first beyond the simple things. \u00a0 So, like any good geek, I started to research.<\/p>\n<p>Since there is an Alexa App built into the Amazon IOS app, I started playing around with a few things. \u00a0 The one thing I can say I&#8217;m disappointed with is that I need to allow the internet access to my plex server if I wanted to control that. \u00a0 That scenario is out. \u00a0 So is at present time streaming easily from iTunes. \u00a0 However, I did get my lights working and controlled via voice. \u00a0 There was a bit of trial an error since I&#8217;m new to the setup, but first timers without having done things many different ways, shouldn&#8217;t have any issues.<\/p>\n<p>This leads up to my love of ifttt and the fact that I still run tons of desktop utilities. \u00a0 Since many utilities run on remote servers, I normally log int remotely and trigger them manually. \u00a0 I thought it would be great to get a couple of these working with Alexa. \u00a0 However, there seems to be many options to do this. \u00a0 Many are convoluted so, while mine is simple to me, it may not be the best for you.<\/p>\n<p>To start with you need an Alexa device (mine was my iPhone) and have it connected to <a href=\"https:\/\/ifttt.com\/\">Ifttt <\/a>(If This Then That). \u00a0The next thing you need is a dropbox account (or any other cloud storage provider supported by Ifttt). \u00a0 So what I did was create a new ifttt applet that runs when I tell Alexa &#8220;trigger network backup&#8221;. \u00a0 This applet creates a file in dropbox called runme.txt. \u00a0 I created a scheduled task that runs a vbs script. \u00a0This script is solely so I can run a batch file silently. \u00a0 You can run the batch file directly &#8211; but you will get the annoying cmd pop-up.<\/p>\n<p>The batch file being called by the scheduled task is as follows:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>@echo off<\/p>\n<p>del c:\\scripts\\ifttt\\ifttt.bat<\/p>\n<p>type c:\\users\\me\\dropbox\\ifttt\\runme.txt &gt;c:\\scripts\\ifttt\\ifttt.bat<\/p>\n<p>del c:\\users\\me\\dropbox\\ifttt\\runme.txt<\/p>\n<p>c:\\scripts\\ifttt\\ifttt.bat<\/p>\n<p>del c:\\scripts\\ifttt\\ifttt.bat<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In case of reboots or hangs I have the running batch file deleted. \u00a0This runs as a scheduled task that kicks off every 5 minutes. \u00a0 So my commands are delayed, but it required the bare minimum of system resources and auxiliary software. \u00a0I may change to a more instant method in the future.<\/p>\n<p>When I setup a specific trigger on Ifttt the contents of runme.txt have the path to the batch file I want to run. \u00a0 So if I say &#8220;trigger network backup&#8221;, ifttt looks at the applet, it then makes the runme.txt file with the contents being c:\\scripts\\backup.bat. \u00a0 When this run it kicks off a robocopy job that mirrors my servers. \u00a0 I can also make a trigger back that alerts when a job is done.<\/p>\n<p>As I create more scripts or logic to run I can do this for many other tasks in the future. \u00a0 I&#8217;ll be able to trigger jobs on different systems by changing \u00a0a different machine to watch for runme2.txt, runme3.txt, etc. \u00a0 It&#8217;s simple an efficient. \u00a0 Now, if only I could rename the wake word of the echo to Jane&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Like half of America, I made a purchases yesterday that threw me into the Amazon ecosystem. \u00a0 Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be the proud owner of a couple Amazon Echo devices. \u00a0 One thing that really interested &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95421,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95420"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=95420"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/95420\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95421"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=95420"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=95420"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=95420"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
