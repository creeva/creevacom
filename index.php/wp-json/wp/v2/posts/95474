It&#8217;s a wonderful feeling and the only thing missing is an alcoholic drink in my hands.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t I wish.<\/p>\n<p>What I am doing is looking at my pet projects, or like I call them the fever of the minute things I need to get done. I still have family pictures to scan and return. I went white-hot on genealogy research for a few weeks last year and need to get back on that. I received a new 3DS for christmas and I&#8217;m back on heavier gaming (Legend of Zelda &#8211; Link Between Worlds is awesome). I need to actually write something and get it on my site&#8230;..wait I&#8217;m doing that now. Disregard that last statement.<\/p>\n<p>It seems though we all deal with the struggle of time. As you are young time seems infinite. These days it seems that there is only a single month in the year. I go to any my tasks and think, I will get to that in a couple of days. I look up and it&#8217;s been six months and I can&#8217;t fathom how I didn&#8217;t get it done.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m lucky my christmas lights are down thanks to a break in the weather the first week of January. However, I did miss a couple of strands on a tree in the front yard &#8211; so they aren&#8217;t all down, but should be when I&#8217;m home and the weather isn&#8217;t snow drenched.<\/p>\n<p>To top it off, my son is disappointed that my 3DS can&#8217;t connect to my hotel wi-fi. He was hoping he could play Mario Kart with me when I was on the road. Next trip out I&#8217;ll have a wifi adapter packed so I can turn my machine into a hot spot.<\/p>\n<p>I just wanted to vent. I hope you enjoy the picture of the A-Team van I found in Omaha Nebraska.<\/p>\n<p>Back to it&#8230;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I haven&#8217;t had to travel in a few months, yet this week I&#8217;m in the tropical state of Nebraska enjoying the breeze through the palm trees while I dip my feet into the water.
