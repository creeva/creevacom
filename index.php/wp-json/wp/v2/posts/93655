This makes them more expensive, but it doesn&#8217;t mean they are not worth the money. \u00a0 It also doesn&#8217;t mean you need to buy a\u00a0Ferrari\u00a0just to drop your kids off at school. \u00a0 For some people this is overkill.<\/p>\n<p>Ipads are also cheap. \u00a0 This in relative speaking of course. \u00a0 Over the last two years companies have made many Android tablets that were on par with the iPad from a specification and\u00a0quality\u00a0perspective. \u00a0 The bad part of this of course was that they were all just as or more expensive than the iPad. \u00a0 You also ran into the issue that until the last year, most user experience on an Android device was nowhere near as snappy as an iOS device. \u00a0 So you ended up paying more for a device that felt slower than the iPad.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft has announced it&#8217;s Surface tablet with removable keyboard. \u00a0 The speculation is that this will be more expensive than either the iPad or a top of the line Android tablet. \u00a0 They are hoping the selling point is that it runs Windows. \u00a0 I&#8217;m guessing they are hoping that corporations will buy it. \u00a0 Maybe they are hoping on the &#8220;wow factor&#8221;, it is a slick-looking device. \u00a0 Sadly we have moved into a single app and browser-based world. \u00a0 That need to have Windows\u00a0compatibility\u00a0is getting less and less. \u00a0 To be wildly successfully they will need to break the four hundred-dollar mark. \u00a0 No analyst has felt that Microsoft could sell it for that cheap.<\/p>\n<p>There are different camps when it comes tablet devices. \u00a0 You have Android and iOS. \u00a0On the fringes you could also find Windows, Blackberry, and Palm\u00a0enthusiasts &#8211; but they are all the minority. \u00a0 We are reliving the Apple vs. Microsoft wars all over again, except Android has replaced Windows. \u00a0 Android also has not learned from Windows OEM&#8217;s mistakes. \u00a0 The OEMs kept pushing to have cheaper and cheaper computers. \u00a0 This did help the computerization of America, but the machines were buggy and broke often. \u00a0 They broke because of hardware and software. \u00a0 This is happening again in the tablet space.<\/p>\n<p>The mythic price of course is 99.99 for a top of the line tablet. \u00a0 Apple will never get there. \u00a0 Amazon and Google are fighting for that spot. \u00a0There is a problem with that. \u00a0 Once tablets reach that price, it will be difficult for the average consumer to ever pay more for a device. \u00a0 This also means any device that costs more will be where Apple will dominate. \u00a0 It will dominate on both specs and quality. \u00a0It can do this because it won&#8217;t have an artificial price restriction it needs to match so they can become the cheapest. \u00a0 You also have the perception that the iPad is better because it costs more. \u00a0 Some people will buy an iPad, not because it fits their needs &#8211; but because it does cost more. \u00a0 You should always buy at the correct price for how you use a device. \u00a0 My routine is ingrained in Apple, so until I feel like I want to change &#8211; this is where I&#8217;m going to stay.<\/p>\n<p>The mythic $99.99 price point is a great deal. \u00a0 I could see buying a couple extra Android tablets to play with at this price. \u00a0 Once a price ceiling has been reached, people have a hard time paying more for something. \u00a0 There are many avenues where this has occurred in just the last fifteen years.<\/p>\n<p>Do you remember paying per the minute after you reached your fifteen hour per month ISP? \u00a0Competitors kept offering more and more hours at the same price. \u00a0Eventually the amount of hours became virtually unlimited. \u00a0 This of course changed over to real unlimited Internet use. \u00a0 The ISP&#8217;s keep talking about charging for the amount of bandwidth you use or doing hourly restrictions again. \u00a0 They are unsuccessful so far because we made it to unlimited. \u00a0 How do you talk someone to pay more for less?<\/p>\n<p>We also saw this with digital music (and it&#8217;s happening again with e-books). \u00a0 Ninety-nine cents became the sweet spot for buying a song. \u00a0 It is arbitrary and some people think it is still expensive, but that seems to be where music is going to be stuck. \u00a0 This means even if there is inflation, you will always get your music for under a dollar. \u00a0 It also means as inflation occurs, the music companies will be earning less overall.<\/p>\n<p>One 99.99 is the new standard for &#8220;premium&#8221; tablets such as the Kindle Fire and Nexus X in the future the only where to go is down. \u00a0 With app sales and media sales it could be argued that the tablets could be given away for free. \u00a0 This would impede any third-party from entering the market. \u00a0 We will have Apple still being a viable company and Amazon, Google (and maybe Microsoft) controlling everything. \u00a0Innovation and true competition will go out the window due to consumers not being willing to pay more for less. \u00a0Sadly, I think that might be where we wind up in the next five years.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy your cheap devices now. \u00a0 More restrictions and DRM will be imposed on them to make them more practical long-term for the manufacturer. \u00a0The real business will be the media and no longer the hardware (I would prefer the reverse). \u00a0Your data will no longer be your own and it will be harder for you to extract it. \u00a0Those cheap tablets have to be paid for somehow, and tracking your usage and\u00a0targeting\u00a0data will be how they do it. \u00a0In the end no device will be yours, it will be something you use &#8211; but you don&#8217;t own it. \u00a0 This is what really happens when you get involved in a race to the bottom.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Amazon announced it&#8217;s new Kindle lines today. \u00a0 The first thing that is going to hit everyone is the price drops. \u00a0 If we focus on the Android based tablet line, Amazon released the &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":93657,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93655"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=93655"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/93655\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/93657"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=93655"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=93655"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/10.10.2.102\/creevacom\/index.php\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=93655"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
