with a metal bar in the middle of it. \u00a0 The bar does not give power, it serves only a guide to keep the car on the path.<\/p>\n<p>You can in theory just hold the gas pedal down and rattle along through the path without bothering to steer.\u00a0You can also steer completely wrong, banging and fighting the bar like most children do.<\/p>\n<p>The real skill that we used to play with is trying to drive the car without hitting the bar once. \u00a0 In theory that sounds like it would be easy, but there actually was little play on either side of the bar. \u00a0Even on the straight away keeping it off the bars was tricky.<\/p>\n<p><center><\/center>The Cadillac Cars were the first ones to arrive at the park. \u00a0 Out of three sets of this ride type I would say I rode this the second most. \u00a0I am assuming it was quite popular since they built two more of them. \u00a0I never would have understood waiting a half hour to get on them though.<\/p>\n<p>The ride had two wooden &#8220;bridges&#8221; that went over a stream. \u00a0When you made it to the end the attendant did their best to jump on the running boards and take control. \u00a0If they didn&#8217;t you could cause (sometimes intentionally) a multiple car pile up as one car banged into the next down the row.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/people\/andrewb94\/\">Scene of The Turnpike Cars taken by Andrew Borgen<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Turnpike Cars \u00a0shared the same field as the Cadillac Cars. \u00a0 The cars were smaller and designed like sports cars. \u00a0In the picture above you can see one designed to resemble a Shelby Cobra. \u00a0 The wooden bridge in the background is part of the Cadillac Cars.<\/p>\n<p>The neatest thing about the Turnpike Cars was the bridge that cars could pass underneath. \u00a0 The problem with getting older in the Turnpike Cars is that these cars were harder to get into as you got older. \u00a0 The Antique and Cadillac Cars were much more friendly to the over 5&#8242;
